               examples/extended/visualization/perspective
               ------------------------------------------

This example is another example of using the Geant Visualization
System as a "stand-alone" graphics library and viewer.  See
examples/extended/visualization/standalone for a simpler
introductory explanation.

The particular feature of this example is the addition of "perspective
lines".  The direction of these lines is controlled by

  /perspectiveDemo/optionString x

See vis.mac.

Notes:
- /perspectiveDemo/scene is not used at present.
- visXm.mac is specially for use with G4UIXm and OGL*Xm.
