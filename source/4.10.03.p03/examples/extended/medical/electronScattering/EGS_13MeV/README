EGSnrc Simulations
------------------

These results were computed with EGSnrc using tutorial codes.
For each geometry, 20E6 primaries were simulated and a phase 
space was scored after the exit window.
Data analysis was performed using the beamdp program 
by Ma and Rogers included in BEAMnrc distribution.
