This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.

\section monopole_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION

 The geometry consists of a single block of a homogenous material,
 placed in a world.

 Four parameters define the geometry :
    - the material of the box 
    - the thickness of the box 
    - the tranverse dimension of the box 
    - the maximal step size in target

 The default is 10 cm of alumunium, step is limited by 5mm.
 Equivalent UI commands are following:
\verbatim
/testex/det/setMat G4_Al
/testex/det/sizeX  10 cm
/testex/det/sizeYZ 5 cm
/testex/det/setStepSize 5 mm
\endverbatim

 The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
 the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class. After changing
 material and/or dimentions one must update the detector construction:
\verbatim
/testex/det/update
\endverbatim

\section monopole_s2 PHYSICS LIST

 Physics Lists include standard QGSP physics and additional builder
             for monopole physics.
 To define monopole parameters an extra string should be provided
   a) interactive mode by UI command:
\verbatim
/monopole/setup 2 0 200 GeV (magnetic number, electric number, mass)
\endverbatim
      b) batch mode:
\verbatim
% monopole file.mac '2 0 200 GeV'  
\endverbatim

\section monopole_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 block perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
 the macros provided with this example).
 The default is monopole 100 GeV

 In addition one can define randomly the impact point of the incident
 particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
 PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.

 A RUN is a set of events.

\section monopole_s4 VISUALIZATION

 The Visualization Manager is set in the main (), see monopole.cc, for interactive session.
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via the command
\verbatim
/control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim

 The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.

 The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.

\section monopole_s5 HOW TO START ?

  - Execute Test  in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
% monopole  monopole.in
\endverbatim

  - Execute Test  in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
% monopole
....
Idle> type your commands
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim


\section monopole_s6 HISTOGRAMS

 The result is five histograms:
    - Monopole eneregy deposition in current material
    - dedx for proton
    - dedx for monopole
    - range for proton in current material
    - range for monopole in current material

 The histogram is saved in Root file.
 Limit of bin size can be set with testex/run/binSize (default 5mm). Real size
 is chosen as a minimal between this and step limit (see Geometry section)
