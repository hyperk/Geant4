#LXe Example Walkthrough
#-----------------------
#
#Follow these steps to see what this example can do.
#
#You can also execute steps 3-7 of this walkthrough as a macro file
#/control/execute WALKTHROUGH

#1) Compile
#>cd LXe/
#>gmake

#2) Launch the program
#>$G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/LXe

#3) Run a basic event

#3a) Run initialize - do this only once
/run/initialize

#3b)Turn on verbose output at end of event
#   We'll leave it on for the rest of the events in the walkthrough too
/LXe/eventVerbose 1

#3c)Run
/run/beamOn

#You will see a blue trajectory representing the gamma and some green
#trajectories representing the optical photons that hit the sphere and
#went into a pmt. Any pmt that had a trajectory drawn and is above it's
#threshold(1) will be redrawn red.

#4) Run a cerenkov cone event
/control/execute cerenkov.mac
/run/beamOn

#You will see a circle of PMTs that have lit up from the optical photons
#produced by the cerenkov process. The cone does not fill in because the
#primary particle was killed after one step in the scintillator.

#5) Run a wls event
/control/execute wls.mac
/run/beamOn

#You will see a number of green and red trajectories drawn. The green ones
#are the optical photons produced by scintillation. The red ones are created
#by the wavelength shifting(WLS) fibers which absorbed the scintillation
#photons and re-emited them at a different wavelength. Most of the WLS photons
#then travel down the fibers to the edge of the slab.

#6) Modify the geometry yourself

#6a)Turning the sphere off
/LXe/detector/defaults
/LXe/detector/volumes/sphere 0
/LXe/detector/update

#6b)Changing the dimensions
/LXe/detector/dimensions 15 15 50 cm
/LXe/detector/update

#6c)Changing the PMTs
/LXe/detector/pmtRadius 0.5 cm
/LXe/detector/nx 15
/LXe/detector/ny 15
/LXe/detector/nz 50
/LXe/detector/update

#7) Test your new geometry
/gun/particle gamma
/run/beamOn

#Done
