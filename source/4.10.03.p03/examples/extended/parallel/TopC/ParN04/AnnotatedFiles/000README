The files in this directory are the files that were used to build
 ../include/Marshaled*.hh .  The files ../include/Marshaled*.hh contain
marshaling (serialization) routines that are used by Parallel Geantr4.

Marshalgen is a package that allows one to add a small number of annotations
to the original sequential code, in order to create marshalling or
serialization routines.  Those marshalling routines are then used
by ParGeant4 to pass data between slave processes and the master process.

INPUT FILES:
1.  G4*.hh :  The files *.hh are taken from Geant4.  They include annotations
	(comments) that describe how to marshal individual fields of the
	given classes.  These files have additional annotations that describe
	how to marshal individual fields of the given classes.  For a new
	application, you have to change any references to Ex* to your
	own example/application include files.  These files are then reused
	in the new Geant4 parallel application.	
2.  ../include/Ex*Hit.hh : These files are the original sequential Geant4
	application files that describe the application-defined hits.  
	They remain in the application include directory because they may
	depend on other files in the include directory.
	For most new parallel Geant4 applications, these files are sufficiently
	simple, that one needs only to add Marshalgen begin and end comments
	bracketing the class that needs to be marshalled, and a small number
	of annotations specifying accessor functions to get and set fields
	in the class.  It may also be necessary to include marshalling
	include files, if it is necessary to marshal other Geant4 data
	structures.
	Information on how to marshal the fields, etc., is in the Marshalgen
	manual, along with the Marshalgen package:
		http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/marshalgen
	

Marshalgen was then called on the above input files.  One calls:
  ./marshalgen *.hh
  ./marshalgen ../include/Ex*Hit.hh

OUTPUT FILES:
3.  *.msh : These files are intermediate files generated automatically
	by marshalgen  ( http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/marshalgen )
	These files can be deleted if desired.
4.  Marshaled*.h : These files are generated by Marshalgen.  They
	include of type both MarshaledEx*.h and MarshaledG4*.h .
	(In addition, the file MarshaledObj.h is copied directly from
	the Marshalgen distribution.)  These files are all copied to
	the include directory of the Geant4 parallel application.
	They provide the marshalling functions that are then used by Geant4.
