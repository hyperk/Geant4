README file relative to proton experimental Bragg peaks


Description of experimental data file provided and of the 
corresponding simulation configuration to use for the comparison

--> 62MeVInWater.root
    Bragg peak acquired in the CATANA protontherapy facility at INFN-LNS (I).
    It can be reproduce with the complete passive beam line of Hadrontherapy. 
    This file contains one ntuple with two columns: 
    the depth in water (expressed in millimiter) and the energy deposited (expressed in arbitrary units).
    Use the proton_therapy.mac file to perform a simulation whose result can be compared with this file.
    The .out file contains the same data in ASCII format.
