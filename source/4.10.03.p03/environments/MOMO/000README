How to use momo-src.jar

momo-src.jar is the Java archive file which contains all Java source files and
relevant data files, as well as a Geant4.9.4 example in ./MomoHome directory.

If you use MOMO.jar to run MOMO, momo-src.jar isn't necessary.
When you have new JDK or other JDK like OpenJDK etc, momo-src.jar can be used
to create your own MOMO.jar.

The required tools are
1) JDK-1.6 or later   (OpenJDK isn't tested fully)
2) Apache ant (1.7 or later)

To compile,


1) copy momo-src.jar to any clean directory and change directory to there
2) jar fvx momo-src.jar   and you have the full codes and data.
3) ant    (build.xml is use by default)        and you have MOMO.jar the executable MOMO jar file
4) java -jar ./MOMO.jar

you may have a warning on the unsecure use of the HashTable but you can neglect it.
