   - Lesson1withN03.py
	- physics is list is taken from examples/novice/N03
	- process on/off
   - Leson1Wx.py
	- same as Lesson1withN03 but
	- New GUI toolkit is used and the default Python isn't enough
	- wxPython is necessary

The first version of the courseware of the mass attenuation coefficient

  - Lesson1.py
       select absorber material
       set its thickness upto 500 mm
       select beam particle
       set its energy upto 100 MeV
       set nu of events up to 100
       run

      and then
        zoom in (x1.1) or zoom out (x0.9)
        pan in up/down and/or right/left in the unit of mm (type in two
            numbers separated by a space)

      execute any G4 command but /gun/particle or /gun/energy which are
      defined by the above 

 -oglx.mac
      OGLSX  => important to make zooming effective after showing trajectories.

      if you want to use VRML, you have to specify the directory where *.wrl
        file is stored and the VRML viewer to which the path is set:
	G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR=/home/yoshidah/tmp/
	G4VRMLFILE_VIEWER=vrmlview

       And you have VRML drivers built.
	G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER=1
	G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE=1
	G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER=1
	G4VIS_USE_VRML=1


 -gun.mac
      This is used only at the initialization time.
