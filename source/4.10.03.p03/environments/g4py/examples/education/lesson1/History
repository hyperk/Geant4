The first version of mass attenuation coefficient

  - Lesson1.py
       select absorber material
       set its thickness upto 500 mm
       select beam particle
       set its energy upto 100 MeV
       set nu of events up to 100
       run

      and then
      zoom in (x1.1) or zoom out (x0.9)

      execute any G4 command but /gun/particle or /gun/energy which are
      defined by the above 

 -oglx.mac
      OGLSX  => important to make zooming effective after showing trajectories
 -gun.mac
