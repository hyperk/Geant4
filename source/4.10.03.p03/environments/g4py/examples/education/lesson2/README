Geant4.8.1 release
===============================================
Prerequisites for G4 environment variables.
==============================================

This scripts offers the choice of visualization systems;
one among OGLSX (OpenGL stored mode), or VRML2FILE or Wired3.

OGLSX is the default viewer and you need no environment variables.

To use VRML2FILE you have to specify its viewer which is found in your
search path and the destination directory where *.wrl file is stored.
If you don't specify the name of the viewer, you can't choose it on the panel.
For example, 
     setenv G4VRMLFILE_VIEWER    $HOME/bin/vrmlview
     setenv G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR  $HOME/tmp/    <= terminate with /

To use Wired, download it and install under your directory. Java Runtime
Environment is necessary.
Then set, for example;
      setenv G4HEPREPFILE_VIEWER $HOME/Wired/bin/wired <= any path you use
      setenv G4HEPREPFILE_DIR    $HOME/tmp/
      setenv G4HEPREPFILE_NAME lesson2_00  <= any name you choose.
      setenv G4HEPREPFILE_OVERWRITE 1      <= to reuse the file for "next event"
G4HEPREPFILE_VIEWER isn't an official Geant4 environment variable but is employed
here to control the vissssualization viewers. 
The name of the HepRepFile is ${G4HEPREPFILE_NAME}.heprep which will be
stored in ${G4HEPREPFILE_DIR}.

ExN03.py script don't use VRML or Wired if their *_VIEWER isn't set.
But other env variables are also used in the script to look for the
file and to activate the viewer, you have to set all of the above variables
in the shell where you activate ExN03.py script.


NOTICE) VRML viewer blocks the window (modal), so that you have to exit it to
display another run.

*********  ExN03.py script ***********

This example id derived from examples/novice/N03.
You can 
  - choose the materials of absorber and gap 
  - set the thickness of the absorber and gap
  - set the lateral (in YZ plane) size of the sandwitch cal.
  - choose an incedent particle
  - set its energy
  - set the number of events to run
  - toggle on/off of the electromagnetic processes
  - set cut length
  - set magnetic field
  - typein any Geant4 command (except related with the above functions) and execute it

How to run it?
    %python ExN03.py

You can visualize with OpenGL stored mode or VRML or Wired3
You can choose either of the active viewers by pushing the
radio buttons.
=========================
NOTICE)

VRML viewer runs in the modal action, and you have to exit it
to have a new diaplay for the new run, or you want to switch to
another viewer.

Wired has the "next"/"previous" event button. So to see the next
event, first run and then "next" event. Wired doesn't block G4
and you can have Wired and OGLSX both open.



ExN03-Wired.py is OBSOLETE. Please use ExN03.py
