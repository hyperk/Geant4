                 Geant4 5.2 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                            27 August 2003

List of fixes included in this public patch to release 5.2:

  o Configuration scripts:
    ---------------------
    + WIN32-VC.gmk, WIN32-VC7.gmk:
      o reinstated options "-D_CONSOLE -D_WIN32 -DOS" to allow correct
        treatment/opening of data files at run-time.

  o Electromagnetic processes (standard):
    ------------------------------------
    + muons:
      o Fixed bug of printout in G4MuIonisation.

  o Hadronic processes:
    ------------------
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space
      o Added protection against a rounding problem in the CHIPS
        evaporation. Fixes a problem observed in gamma-nuclear reactions.
    + models/generator/de_excitation
      o Fixed usage of arguments to pow() function (porting on
        .NET 7.1 compiler).
    + models/generator/quark_gluon_string
    + models/generator/string_fragmentation
      - Implemented the handling of diffractive photon scattering in
        the parton string models. Mandatory for high energy gamma and
        electro-nuclear reactions.
    + models/neutron_hp:
      o Corrected an error affecting the neutron energy distribution 
        in Fission. Mandatory for fission in Uranium 235.
    + stopping:
      o Fixed few cases of memory leaks occuring at every new run.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Add one void pointer to G4DynamicParticle for the sake of maintaining
      links between pre-assigned decay products and corresponding primary
      particle.

  o Transportation:
    --------------
    + G4Transportation: 
      o Added verbosity level to control the printing of warnings. 
      o Attempt to correct photon problem by using the velocity from current
        medium for massless particles. 
      o Use the finalVelocity to update TofF for optical photons.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + RayTracer:
      o Fixed incomplete migration to Cuts per Region scheme, causing
        tracing process to crash in release 5.2.

  o Examples:
    --------
  - Updated reference outputs.
  - extended:
    o eventgenerator/HepMC
      + fixed compilation errors due to incorrect code migration from
        g4std wrappers. 
      + fixed pedantic compilation warnings on Linux-g++. 
    o gdml
      + Fixed trivial compilation errors originated by recent g4std
        migration. 
      + Fixed pedantic compilation warnings on Linux-g++.
    o g3tog4
      + Fixed pedantic compilation warnings on Linux-g++.
    o parallel
      + Fixed pedantic compilation warnings on Linux-g++.
