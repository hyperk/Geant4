                 Geant4 4.0 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                      28th February 2002

List of fixes included in this public patch to release 4.0, to be added on
top of patch-01:

  o Config:
    ------
    - liblist.c: added flags __CYGWIN__ and __CYGWIN32__ for triggering proper
      parsing algorithm on Windows systems, also on most recent versions of
      Cygwin.
    - WIN32-VC.gmk: use g77 instead of f77 as default fortran compiler.
    - sys/HP-aCC.gmk: removed include path to
      global/management/include/std/wrappers, which was unused and not
      necessary.

  o Decay processes:
    ---------------
    - Removed a physics table from G4Decay.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    - Fixed bug in G4Ve(h)EnergyLoss, G4VMuEnergyLoss:
      o Adopt MinDeltaCut in-range instead of in-energy !
    - G4VEnergyLoss:
      o Set subSecFlag to false. NO default subcutoff generation.
      o Set finalRange to 1mm as default (the actual value is computed in
        G4VeEnergyLoss, G4VhEnergyLoss and G4VMuEnergyLoss).

  o Event:
    -----
  - Optimised implementation of SetNewValue() in G4ParticleGunMessenger and 
    G4GeneralParticleSourceMessenger to allow porting on WIN32-VC for optimised
    compilation. 

  o Geometry:
    --------
  - Management:
    o G4GeometryManager.cc: fixed handling of ios manipulators and precision
      to reset to their original state in G4GeometryManager::ReportVoxelStats().
      Fixes problem report #343.
  - Volumes:
    o G4GeometryMessenger.cc: fixed local variable name not to clash with
      class data member. 
  - solids/Boolean:
    o G4ReflectionFactory.cc: fixed bug causing repetition of daughter volumes.
    o G4ReflectedSolid[.hh.cc]: 
      - Defined new methods Set/GetTransform3D() and Set/GetDirectTransform3D() 
        for defining/accessing the reflected transformation.
    o Moved utility methods for G4AffineTransform to protected.
  - solids/BREPS:
    o Bug fixes to G4BREPSolidPolyhedra: 
      - Added enhancement allowing to define RMIN and RMAX to be zero with the 
        exception of forbidden two consecutive zero RMAX values. 
      - Refactoring in constructor gained two new private methods for creation
        of trapezoidal and triangular side planes of G4BREPSolidPolyhedra. 
      - Rewritten code for delta phi >= 2*PI case with full classification of
        possible cases. 
      - Fixed sense of end planes. 
      - Fixed delta phi < 2*PI case where some old code remained after bug
        fix #266. 
      - Added new private method for creation of planar surfaces gained 
        after code refactoring in constructor. 
      - Fixed bug for problem report #354 by adding the code handling the
        cases where user supplies for the same z-section different RMIN or
        RMAX values.
      - Added more preconditions checks 
      - Added code forbidding "teeth" in polyhedra.
    o G4ConvexHull.hh: moved initialisation of 'next' to constructor's body. 
  - solids/CSG:
    o G4Sphere.cc: bug-fix in Inside() function. Fixes problem report #216. 
    o G4Para.cc: fixed bug in G4Para::Inside() in calculation of xt,
      according to problem report #357.
  - solids/STEPinterface:
    o G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator.cc: fixed unsafe usage of
      '<' operator. 

  o Hadronic processes:
    ------------------
    o Fixes in pre-equilibrium and de-excitation generator models.
    o Fixed bug in doppler broadening in neutron-transport model:
      - Fixed sign error in calculation of effective luminosity.
    o Stopping: trivial bug-fix in pi-absorption at rest. 
    o Util:
      - Trivial bug-fix, affecting K-absorption at rest.
      - G4Nucleus: moved definition of constructors/destructor from header to
        source implementation file. Unresolved symbols were detected at link
        time on SUN-CC for static constants used to initialise members in
        inline constructors. 
    o CHIPS model: fixed accuracy problem.
    o Optimised implementation in G4Fancy3DNucleus.cc to allow porting on
      WIN32-VC for optimised compilation. 

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    - Fixed for odd behavior of G4UIcsh in Windows systems.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    - Optimised implementation of GetIndex() for fIndexTable in G4Material,
      G4Element and G4Isotope.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    - Fixed bug in the decay table for G4KaonMinus.

  o Track & Tracking:
    ----------------
    - track:
      o Added G4Track::CopyTrackInfo().
      o Optimised G4ParticleChange::AddSecondary() to properly use touchable
        handles.
      o Fixed a bug of changing parent weight in
        G4ParticleChange::UpdateStepForAlongStep().
      o Optimised implementation in G4Track::GetVelocity().
    - tracking:
      o G4SteppingManager2.cc:
        - fix for extra steps when the ApplyCuts flag is set 
        - G4SteppingManager.hh: changed scope for 'SizeOfSelectedDoItVector'
          to allow porting on WIN-VC compiler.
      o Fix in G4SteppingManager::SetInitialStep() for applyCuts. 

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    - HepRep: added check for missing hierarchy layers in HepRepXMLWriter. 
    - Bug fix in modeling: removed Begin/EndPrimitives from G4HitsModel and
      G4TrajectoriesModel. This was causing nested calls to Begin/EndPrimitives
      (and thus to glNewList/EndList in OpenGL stored mode), since the
      trajectories and hits Draw methods themselves have Begin/EndPrimitives.

  o Examples:
    --------
    - extended/electromagnetic/testem1,3,4,5:
      o Improvements in PrimaryGenerator and macros
    - novice/N03:
      o New macros for tutorials/exercises.
