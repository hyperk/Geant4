                 -----------------------------------

                                                      31st July 2002

List of fixes included in this public patch to release 4.1:

  o Config:
    ------
    - Upgraded WIN32-g++ setup to compile with -ansi and gcc-2.95.3 for
      most recent versions of CygWin. 

  o Electromagnetic processes (low-energy):
    --------------------------------------
    - Bug fix in delta-electron spectra.
    - Bug fix in simulation of EM processes in compounds.
    - Optimised loading of data in G4AugerData.

  o Event:
    -----
    - G4PrimaryParticle:
      o Bug fixed in the initialisation of 'charge' for all constructors.

  o Geometry:
    --------
  + magnetic-field:
    - G4FieldManager:
      o made 'fDefault_Delta_One_Step_Value' and 
        'fDefault_Delta_Intersection_Val' non static constants to resolve
        initialisation problems. Fixes problem report #383. 
    - G4ChordFinder: 
      o in NewStep, fixed case of stepTrial >> stepTrialOld, to take
        large multiple - not small 
      o added guard for stepTrial==0.0 in FindNextChord(). 
    - G4MagIntegratorDriver: 
      o added protection against error of 0.0 in ComputeNewStepSize. 
      o cleared warning of unused variable.
    - G4EquationOfMotion: 
      o made RightHandSide() an inline method 
      o in GetFieldValue() signature of Point is double[4],
        instead of double[3] 
      o defined G4maximum_number_of_field_components as enum. 
  + solids/CSG:
    - G4Cons:
      o Bug fixed in DistanceToIn(p,v) concerning z-crossing at
        the edge with Rmin,Rmax.
  + solids/STEP:
    - Fixed GNUmakefile to parse 'g++' string in G4SYSTEM to detect
      non-ISO setup for gcc-2.95 and higher.
  + solids/STEPinterface:
    - Fixed GNUmakefile to parse 'g++' string in G4SYSTEM to detect
      non-ISO setup for gcc-2.95 and higher.
  + verification:
    - G4GeomTestVolume:
      o Fixed recursive call to G4GeomTestVolume to consider also
        'tolerance' as argument in the recursive test algorithm.
  + volumes:
    - Code cleanup and cosmetics for most classes.
    - G4PropagatorInField:
      o In ComputeStep(), reset status to original by setting 'fNoZeroStep'
        to zero if (fNoZeroStep > fAbandonThreshold_NoZeroSteps).
        Fixes a problem observed in cases when a looping track is killed,
        the bug was causing also subsequent tracks to be killed.
      o Removed not-implemented constructor taking G4Navigator* as argument. 
      o Get rid of static const data for default 'epsilonStep' size. 
      o Initialised all data members in constructor!

  o Global:
    ------
    - G4Allocator:
      o Moved page size to become data-member of G4Allocator.
        'fPageSize' is now computed according to the size of the object 
        to be allocated. The default size is 1024 bytes for objects whose
        size is less than 512 bytes, 10 times the size of the object otherwise. 

  o Hadronic processes:
    ------------------
  + management, utils, models/high_energy:
    o Introduced accounting of strange baryons. 
    o Introduced accounting for anti-nucleons and strange mesons. 
    o Improved treatement of inelasticity for annihilation events and pion 
      absorptive reactions. 
    o Added protection in the call to phase-space method for pion induced
      reactions.
    o Fixed error in energy conservation observed by BTEV. 
      Used to show (1/500) for 1.5-2.5 GeV pion reactions in medium A nuclei. 
  + cross-sections:
    o Fixed bug in caching information in gamma nuclear cross-sections
      (G4PhotoNuclearCrossSection). 

  o Examples:
    --------
    - Corrected README in exampleN01.
    - Updated reference outputs.
