                 Geant4 6.2 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           26 October 2004

List of fixes included in this public patch since release 6.2-patch-01:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + divisions:
      o Removed unnecessary debug printout in method
        G4PVDivision::CheckAndSetParamenters().
    + management:
      o G4Region: added map for storage of materials/cuts and methods for
        handling registration of couples in the map, finding a couple
        according to a given material, clearing the map's storage.
        Extensions necessary to resolve correct update of material-cut
        couples in parameterised geometries by material.
      o G4LogicalVolume: added method UpdateMaterial() to refresh a
        material/cut couple in the corresponding region.
        Extension necessary to resolve correct update of material-cut
        couples in parameterised geometries by material.
      o Fixed G4RegionStore::Clean() to avoid deletion of world region.
    + navigation:
      o G4Navigator: corrected computation of fGrandMotherExitNormal in
        ComputeStep() in the case where a not valid exit-normal exists.
      o G4GeomTestSegment: fix to correctly determine whether starting
        trajectory is entering or exiting the solid when the starting point
        is on a surface. Added additional tests on solid consistencies
        (from roundoff sometimes) to avoid incorrect overlap warnings.
        Addresses problem reports #610 and #652.
      o Dump out contents from the solid when a fatal G4Exception is thrown
        from the navigators in ComputeStep().
      o Invoke G4LogicalVolume::UpdateMaterial() instead of SetMaterial()
        for parameterised navigation in G4Navigator and specialised
        G4ParameterisedNavigation.
        Modification necessary to resolve correct update of material-cut
        couples in parameterised geometries by material.
    + solids/CSG:
      o Fix in G4Cons::DistanceToIn(p,v) on fRmax surface and move in,
        the condition became a bit more strict && determinant >=0, i.e.
        intersections in addition to go in.
        Fixes a rare problem of dIn=dOut=0 observed in 3 events over a
        statistics of 10^8..
      o Fix in G4Sphere::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) on fRmin moving outside.
        The bug showed 3 events of dIn=dOut=0 for 10^7 statistics in the
        unit testing.
      o Bug fix in G4Sphere::SurfaceNormal(p) for theta normals.
    + solids/specific:
      o G4VCSGfaceted: fix for rare anomalous situation in which
        DistanceToOut(p,v,..) will report kInfinity, make an additional
        check for the point p on the surface, in which case will report
        zero. Addresses problem observed in G4Polyhedra and reported in #650.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + Added protection in G4AtomicShells::GetNumberOfShells(Z).
      Fixes problem report #643.
    + Recalculate ionisation parameters after set of new mean ionisation
      potential; added factor 2 to shell correction term.

  o Processes/cuts:
    --------------
    + Fixed bug in G4ProductionCutsTable for the update of materials/cuts
      couple for dynamic setups where material may vary, like in the case
      of parameterization of detectors through material.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + lowenergy:
      o Trivial fixes for removal of redundant semicolons in the code.
    + utils:
      o Fixed a problem of cut dependence of transmission energy of low
        energy e- via thin foil
    + xrays:
      o Changed "StronglyForced" back to "Forced" in GetMeanLifeTime() for
        the G4Scintillation process.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/cascade:
      o Fixed bug in G4CascadeInterface for uncorrect deletion of dynamic
        particles. Fixes problem report #645.

  o Optical Processes:
    -----------------
    + Allow for unified model reflectivity parameters to also work in case
      of dielectric_metal surfaces; in G4OpBoundaryProcess, use GetMaterial()
      from G4StepPoint directly, sample reflectivity and apply unified model
      reflection parameters only once even for rough dielectric/metal
      surfaces. Fixes problem report #654.
    + Fixed bug in G4PlaneVectorRand for G4OpBoundaryProcess and resample
      'theFacetNormal' for LobeReflection in DielectricMetal.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Updated date to run-manager.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + OpenGL: G4OpenGLTransform3D.cc: simplified implementation for
      GetMatrix() to allow for porting on future CLHEP series.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + electromagnetic/MuonProcesses
      o Modified HistoManager and Messenger in order to allow a multirun job.
    + electromagnetic/PhotonProcesses
      o Modified HistoManager and Messenger in order to allow a multirun job.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm2
      o Updated acceptance numbers in input macro.
      o Fixed problem in initialisation of RunAction.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm4
      o Modifications in RunAction for histograms management for JAIDA.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm6
      o Correctly defined all UI subdirectories.
      o Modifications in RunAction for histograms management for JAIDA.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm10
      o Removed obsolete processes from PhysicsList.
    + extended/field
      o Minor cleanup of PhysicsLists.
    + extended/optical
      o Fixed compilation error and warnings for LXe on Linux/gcc compiler.
    + novice/N05
      o Added protection for negative proposed step in ExN05MinEkineCuts.
