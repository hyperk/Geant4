                 Geant4 8.2 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           23 February 2007

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 8.2:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management:
      o Added flag to G4VPhysicalVolume::CheckOverlaps() method for
        controlling verbosity. By default, verbosity is ON.
    + navigation:
      o In G4Navigator, forcing call to CheckOverlaps() on the current
        volume before event abortion for cases of stuck tracks.
      o G4PropagatorInField: implemented ClearPropagatorState()
        to clear track-dependent state (safety, zero-steps, loop flag. etc...).
        Call to this method becomes mandatory in G4Transportation for each new
        track to overcome side effects of safety inconsistency in presence of
        geometry overlaps.
    + solids/specific:
      o Do not scale reducible-polygon in G4Polyhedra::Reset() method.
        The 'original_parameters' structure offered as input through the
        accessors are always assumed to be already scaled by the
        'cos(0.5*phiTotal/theNumSide)' factor.
        Addresses problem report #873.
      o Fix in G4PolyconeSide::DistanceAway() for correct estimation of
        distance for the case of Phi sections.
        Addresses problem report #598.
    + volumes:
      o Added flag for controlling verbosity to CheckOverlaps() method for
        G4PVPlacement and G4PVParameterised. By default, verbosity is ON.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Changed date for patch-01 to release 8.2.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + standard:
      o G4UrbanMscModel:
        - Fix in the single scattering code for heavy particles, now the code
          can be used with skin=1 e+/e- and for heavy particles as well.
        - Removed unecessary call to G4Navigator location method.
        - Added protection inside lateral displacement sampling against cases
          of TrueStepLength < GeomStepLength.
        - Added protections against NaN values in two places: sampling of
          theta when tau=0 in lateral displacement, and in method
          ComputeTrueStepLength() for the case of zero true length.
      o G4MultipleScattering: fix to allow for reinitialisation of model
        parameters between runs.
      o Use SetEmModel(index) and added SetFluctModel() from
        G4VEnergyLossProcess in eIonisation, hIonisation, ionIonisation,
        eBremstrahlung.
    + utils:
      o Fixed a problem happening in interactive sessions when activating or
        deactivating processes; the problem resulting in building wrong dEdx
        tables for e+- and muons. Modified classes are: G4LossTableBuilder,
        G4LossTableManager and G4VEmEnergyLossProcess.
        New tables are added for e+- and muons ionisation additionally to
        total energy loss tables.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/binary_cascade:
      o G4BinaryCascade::Capture(): added protection against division by zero.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space:
      o Fixed cases of division by 0 in G4Quasmon and G4QNucleus.
        and other cases of generation of NaN.
        Reduces segmentation faults in CHIPS-based models and physics lists
        such as QGSC.
      o Fixed bug of generation of NaN in G4QElastic observed in complicated
        event for the multi-projectile case.
        Reduces segmentation faults in elastic scattering.
    + models/de_excitation:
      o Evaporation: added protection to exclude negative probabilities from
        the "competitive channel sum". Together with the fix below for fission
        this should only happen due to a precision error, but is protected
        nonetheless.
      o Fission: fixed probability to no longer be negative. Is now equivalent
        to what is written in the Physics Reference Manual.
        The above two fixes also affect the precompound model which invokes
        these models.
      o Fission: fixed several memory leaks in G4ParaFissionModel.
    + models/low_energy:
      o G4LElastic: added protection against sqrt() of negative value.
    + models/management:
      o For error reporting, added model name arguments and default names to
        constructors for classes G4HadronicInteraction, G4InelasticInteraction,
        G4VIntraNuclearTransportModel and G4VPreCompoundModel.
    + models/neutron_hp:
      o Fixed potential divisions by zero in: G4NeutronHPVector,
        G4NeutronHPLevel and G4NeutronHPInterpolator.
    + models/parton_string/hadronization:
      o G4ExcitedStringDecay::EnergyAndMomentumCorrector(): fixed bug which
        did stop correction even if not yet converged; check on convergence
        must check that scale-1 is close to 0, and not less than 0.
    + models/parton_string/management:
      o Debugged method Dump() added in G4InteractionContent to print object.
      o Debugged output in G4VPartonStringModel checking E-p conservation of
        string model.
        The above two points provide improved, more detailed verbose output.
    + models/parton_string/qgsm:
      o Corrected E-p non-conservation in QGS. In G4QGSMSplitableHadron,
        the smaller of the lightcone momenta Q+/Q- was ignored.
      o Fixed division by 0 in G4QGSMSplitableHadron::SampleX().
      o Added debugging output to several classes.
    + models/util:
      o Added method to G4Parton for setting momentum using both + and -
        momentum component. Should help in improving shower shapes.
      o G4Fragment: more info on warning output of negative excitation energy.
    + processes:
      o Added process names to G4HadronElasticProcess, G4HadronCaptureProcess,
        G4HadronFissionProcess.  This will allow more detailed error reporting.
      o Cleaned up commented-out code.
    + stopping:
      o G4MuMinusCaptureCascade: added sampling of random vector of e- in
        decay; added factor 2 in potential energy - fixing decay spectrum.
      o G4MuonMinusCaptureAtRest: fixed problem for the case when isotope
        vector is undefined. Force to use round 'targetA'.
        Addressing problem report #926.
    + util:
      o G4HadFinalState: corrected initialisation of energy deposition.
        Fix affects elastically scattered neutrons and probably most 
        hadronic models. Reduces the number of events in which the summed
        energy of final particles exceeds that of the incident particle.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4Material: fill fAtomVector in the case when material is built
      from element mass fractions, allowing for low-energy package to
      use NIST G4_WATER.
    + G4NistMaterialBuilder: added liquids O2 and N2.
    + G4NistElementBuilder: added protection for Z<=101.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + Fix in QGSP_BIC_HP list: activated use of HP elastic.
    + G4HadronElasticPhysics: set limits on low energy and QElastic to zero.
    + Fixed special cuts for LBE physics list.
    + Added set min/max Energy and Inelastic Energy to NeutronHP builder.
    + G4EmStandardPhysics: use G4hMultipleScattering for muons and removed
      extra printouts. Use default multiple-scattering setup in
      G4EmStandardPhysics72.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Fix in method G4RunManager::NumberOfEventToBeStored().
      Addressing problem report #925.
    + Added protection against missing particle types before
      BuildPhysicsTable() is invoked. Addressing problem report #923.

  o Transportation:
    --------------
    + G4Transportation: calling PropagatorInField to clear state for new
      track. This addresses a reliabilitiy problem observed by ATLAS; the
      fix is related to overlaps in the geometry, and consists in clearing
      the safety value, which may become multivalued due to overlaps in the
      geometry, and thus can become invalid for a new track in an overlap
      region...
    + Added protection against zero 'velocity' in method
      G4Transportation::AlongStep().

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Updated Configure script to prompt for new version of G4EMLOW data set.

  o Data Sets:
    ---------
    + New data set G4EMLOW4.2: correction to Auger data.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + advanced/underground_physics
      o Removed uninitialized 'UserLimitsForXenon'.
    + extended/extended/TestEm7
      o Cleanup of macros.
    + extended/electromagnetic/TestEm16
      o Added HistoManager and HistoMessenger and commands to modify
        upper step limit. Minor fix to GNUmakefile.
    + extended/radioactivedecay/exrdm
      o Fixed usage of physics-lists and histograms
    + extended/runAndEvent/RE02
      o Fixed missing NULL pointer protection in ComputeMaterial() method.
