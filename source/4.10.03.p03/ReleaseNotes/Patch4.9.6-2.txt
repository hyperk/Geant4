                 Geant4 9.6 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                              17 May 2013

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.6.p01:

  o Error Propagation:
    -----------------
    + Introduced fixes for problem reports #1435, #1447, #1448 and #1453.
    + Fixed memory leak in G4ErrorPropagator::PropagateOneStep() for track
      creation at the first step. Addresses problem report #1466.
      Corrected composed printout. Removed unused data.

  o Event:
    -----
    + Ensure deletion of "angsigmayCmd1" G4UIcommand instance in destructor
      of G4GeneralParticleSourceMessenger, fixing minor memory leak.
    + Removed unused variables in G4AdjointPosOnPhysVolGenerator,
      G4AdjointPosOnPhysVolGenerator, G4GeneralParticleSource,
      G4SPSEneDistribution, and G4SPSRandomGenerator.

  o G3toG4:
    ------
    + Fixed missing inclusion of <assert.h> in G3Division source.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + divisions:
      o Corrected G4PVDivisionFactory instance accessor.
      o Corrected composed cout in exceptions for G4ParameterisationBox
        and G4ParameterisationTrd.
    + magneticfield:
      o Updated numerical value of the neutron anomaly in G4Mag_SpinEqRhs.
      o Removed unused private data-members in G4Mag_UsualEqRhs and
        G4RKG3_Stepper.
    + solids/CSG:
      o Fix in G4Cons::DistanceToIn(p,v) for initialisation of 'dRmax'
        for the case of shape with Rmin1=Rmax1=0.
    + solids/specific:
      o Fix in G4ExtrudedSolid::IsSameLine() to use the perpendicular
        distance to a line when deciding, and not the y-intercept difference.
        Issue responsible for a problem observed in ATLAS in a Boolean
        subtraction composition.
      o Fix in calculation of normal in G4Tet::DistanceToOut(p,v,..) and
        SurfaceNormal(p).
      o Fix in G4Polycone::GetPointOnCone() for cases of shape with decreasing
        Z. Fixes cases of false report for overlaps detection.
        Added check with exception in constructor for polycone with
        rInner > rOuter for the same Z.
        Addressing problem report #1462.
      o G4TessellatedSolid: fixed problem with navigation in solids with
        concave surfaces. Addresses problem report #1456.
      o Removed unused private data member in G4TwistTrapParallelSide.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4Pow: fixed bug in interpolation inside logA() and A13() methods,
      now interpolation is accurate at better than per mille level; in worse
      cases (x~1.45 or x~0.75) better than 2% level.
    + Minor changes to G4ConvergenceTester: output can now optionally be
      redirected a different stream (defaults is cout).
      Accessors are made public and check if data has been added.
    + Removed unused private members in G4JTPolynomialSolver.
    + Updated date and version for 9.6.p02.

  o Graphics Representations:
    ------------------------
    + HepPolyhedron: introduced 'spatialTolerance' constant, equal to 0.01*nm,
      allowing for creation of nm-sized objects.
      Addresses problem report #1452.

  o Electromagnetic Processes:
    -------------------------
    + Adjoint:
      o G4AdjointhMultipleScattering: use msc95 instead of obsolete msc90.
      o Removed unused variables detected with clang compilation warnings.
    + Muons:
      o G4MuPairProductionModel, G4MuBremsstrahlungModel: fixed rare case
        of division by zero in cross-section computation.
        Addressing problem report #1471.
    + Polarisation
      o G4PolarizedComptonCrossSection: removed unused class members.
    + Standard:
      o G4UrbanMscModel93/95/96: disabled 'sampleZ' option by default (this
        option enables/disables sampling of true step length); helps in
        removing rare cases of e+- interactions/decay on geometry boundary
        and observed zero step length; a minor (~0.1%) change in sampling
        calorimeter response is expected.
        Correctly use "static const" for const parameters (minor CPU
        speedup).
      o G4WentzelOKandVIxSection: use different screening parameter formula
        for e+- and other charged particles, improving agreement with data
        both for e+- and muons.

  o Generic Processes:
    -----------------
    + parameterisation:
      o Fixed MacOS Clang compiler warning for unused private variable in
        G4FastSimulationManagerProcess.
    + Scoring:
      o Set verbosity to false in G4ParallelWorldProcess for navigation
        in parallel and mass world, reducing warning messages. 
    + Transportation:
      o G4CoupledTransportation: corrected condition for warning message
        in AlongStepDoIt().
      o G4CoupledTransportation, G4Transportation: removed unnecessary
        static local variables.
      o Removed unused data members causing compilation warnings in
        MacOS clang.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o G4HadronFissionDataSet: always return zero (only HP may simulate
        fission as a separate process).
    + models/im_r_matrix:
      o Fix in G4MesonAbsorption for loss of optimisation shortcut.
        Addressing problem report #1416.
      o Fix in G4CollisionMesonBaryonElastic::IsInCharge(): method always
        returned false, effectively blocking meson-baryon elastic.
        Expect to change distributions. Addressing problem report #1415.
    + models/lll_fission:
      o Fixed MacOS Clang compiler warning for appending int to string
        in G4SmpWatt.
    + models/neutron_hp:
      o Fixed MacOS clang compiler warnings for unused private variables.
    + models/parton_string/diffraction:
      o Fix in G4FTFModel::PutOnMassShell() for K^+ Fe interactions at
        T=4.6748 GeV, resolving observed cases of loops in central collision
        due to sum of the excitation energy and energies of the ejected
        nucleons larger than the initial energy (energy-momentum
        non-conservation). Addressing problem report #1459.
    + models/qmd:
      o Fixed MacOS Clang compiler warnings for unused private variables in
        G4QMDCollision.
    + models/utils:
      o G4NuclearFermiDensity: removed unused data member.
    + stopping:
      o G4EmCaptureCascade: fixed array initialisation.
      o G4MuonMinusBoundDecay: improved muon capture rate data/lookup and
        calculation of bound muon decay rate.
        Corrected calculations and lookup of MuonCaptureRate in
        G4StopElementSelector. Addresses problem report #1457.

  o Parameterisations/gflash
    ------------------------
    + Fixed compilation warning in clang for unused data member in
      GFlashShowerModelMessenger.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Removed unused variable of thePDGiSpin from G4PDGCodeChecker.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + ascii:
      o Corrected problem in placement of an assembly in G4tgbVolume.
        Addressing problem report #1433.
      o Removed unused data member in G4tgbRotationMatrix.
      o Corrected composed text in exception in G4tgrSolidBoolean.
    + gdml:
      o Removed unused data member in G4STRead.
    + mctruth:
      o Removed unused data member in G4PersistencyCenter.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + Increased low limit from 10 eV to 100 eV in G4EmStandardPhysics_option4,
      to fix range of electrons at low energy.
    + G4EmLivermorePhysics: increased low limit to 100 eV and number of bins
      for tables to 220 to avoid problems in Livermore ionisation for
      electron stopping powers and ranges.

  o Track:
    -----
    + Fix in G4ParticleChange for velocity of neutrons and recoil in elastic
      scattering; correspondingly, fixed time of neutron hits in calorimeters.
      Addressing problem report #1451.
    + G4ParticleChangeForEloss, G4ParticleChangeForGamma: clean up
      computation of velocity (expected little performance improvement).

  o Tracking:
    --------
    + Fix in G4SteppingManager to allow for proper handling of multiple AtRest
      processes. Addressing problem report #1397.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + advanced/composite_calorimeter:
      o Fixed compilation error in main() for missing inclusion of
        G4UImanager header. Fixed compilation warnings for
        variables/parameters shadowing.
    + advanced/lAr_calorimeter:
      o Fixed bug in the primary generator, causing event abortion.
    + novice/N02:
      o ExN02PhysicsList: added ions. Addressing problem report #1444.
