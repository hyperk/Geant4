                 -----------------------------------

                                                           27 July 2004

List of fixes included in this public patch since release 6.2:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Configure script:
      o Corrected behavior for setting of CLHEP_BASE_DIR in case the path
        is set to '/usr' or '/usr/local'. Fixes problem report #638.
    + source/GNUmakefile:
      o Fixed search path from absolute to relative. Addresses problem
        report #644.

  o Digits_hits, Event
    ------------------
    + Trivial fixes for removal of redundant semicolons in the code.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + divisions:
      o Removed unnecessary forward declaration of HepTransform3D from
        G4ParameterisationBox and G4VDivisionParameterisation.
    + navigation:
      o Fixed zero step-length problem in G4ReplicaNavigation::ComputeStep()
        for cases where different replica types are coincident. Resolves
        problem report #633.
      o G4NormalNavigation: added extra verbosity to print out information
        for each solid which returns a 'lowest-yet' step, including the
        mother volume. It is activated by setting verbose level to 2 or
        more.
    + solids/BREPS:
      o G4BREPSolidPolyhedra and G4BREPSolidPCone:
        Fixed usage of tolerances fir handling surface distances.
        Implemented SurfaceNormal(p) to follow original specifications
        for G4VSolid.
      o G4BREPSolid:
        Fixed usage of tolerances fir handling surface distances.
      o Some code cleanup ...
    + solids/CSG:
      o Fixes curing rare conditions of loops at boundaries for G4Orb
        and G4Sphere. Addresses problem report #547.

  o Electromagnetic standard processes:
    ----------------------------------
    + standard:
      o Improved cross-section parametrisation at low energy for
        ComptonScattering.
    + utils:
      o Correction in G4MscModel::SampleCosTheta() for high-energy particles
        at small step. Fixes some observed deflection of direction for
        particles at high energies.
      o Fixed a problem of G4VEnergyLossProcess observed for ions at small
        cuts in range (ionization, charge>1).

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/cascade, util:
      o Trivial fixes for removal of redundant semicolons in the code.
    + chiral_inv_phase_space:
      o Fix for clusterization in G4QNucleus. Correcting problem observed
        in system-testing.
      o Fixed initialization of secondary values dZ,dN,dS in G4QNucleus.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Updated date to run-manager.

  o Tracking:
    --------
    + Fix in G4SteppingManager to correct the ordering of secondary tracks
      generated in a step.
    + Moved inlined constructor/destructor for G4Vtrajectory and
      G4VtrajectoryPoint to not inline, and corrected signature of
      operator==() to canonical form. 

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + management: made G4VViewer::ProcessView() public, since used as
      private friend by some client classes.

  o Hadronic Lists:
    --------------
    + Corrected user GNUmakefile sample, to allow for proper installation
      when global compound libraries are used.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + advanced/composite_calorimeter, lAr_calorimeter
      o Fixed configuration setup for hadronic physics lists, to allow
        for proper installation when global compound libraries are used.
    + advanced/Rich, xray_telescope
      o Corrected to new visualization commands in input macro.
    + extended/analysis/A01
      o Fixed configuration setup for hadronic physics lists, to allow
        for proper installation when global compound libraries are used.
    + extended/geometry/olap
      o Reordered storage of parameters for solids according to arguments
        order in construction in SolidAnalyser. Resolving issue in problem
        report #635.
