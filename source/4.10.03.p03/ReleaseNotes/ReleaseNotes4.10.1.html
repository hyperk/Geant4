<H2>3. Items for migration of the user code</H2>

Listed here is some relevant information on developments included in this
release.
Note that for all users a full re-installation of libraries (or a full
re-compilation) and a re-compilation of user applications is required.

<P> </P>
<B>General</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The new version of CLHEP can be built supporting the C++11 Standard,
    on compilers that support C++11.
    When C++11 option is chosen in a multi-threaded build of Geant4,
    this trigers the use of the Standard <TT>thread_local</TT>
    and <TT>atomic</TT> keywords.</LI>
<LI>The procedure of deleting the full geometry for rebuilding a new one from
    scratch has been reviewed. It is suggested to use
    <TT>G4RunManager::ReinitializeGeometry(<I>true</I>)</TT>
    or the equivalent UI command <TT>/run/reinitializeGeometry</TT> rather than
    directly invoke deletion from G4SolidStore, G4LogicalVolumeStore and
    G4PhysicalVolumeStore, to safely delete all previously-defined solids,
    logical and physical volumes.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>4. New Developments and Capabilities </H2>

<B>Geometry</B>
<UL>
<LI>In this release, an option allows an installation to use the
    <A HREF="https://cern.ch/aidasoft/USolids">Unified Solids Library</A>
    primitives, to replace the original Geant4 solids, as in the
    previous release. An additional configuration option enables
    a build against an external installation of the USolids library.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Materials</B>
<UL>
<LI>Preliminary support for phonon propagation
    (see <A HREF="#phonon"><b>Phonon Physics</b></A> below) is provided
    by G4LatticeLogical (which defines parameters for materials) and
    G4LatticePhysical (which associates G4LatticeLogical with a particular
    G4VPhysicalVolume, including lattice orientation). These objects should
    be instantiated in the user's G4VUserDetectorConstruction class.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>A new class G4EmParameters and updated set of UI commands have been
    introduced, allowing easy definition of the EM parameters both in
    sequential and multi-threaded modes.</LI>
<LI>A new option "DisplacementBeyondBoundary" for simulation of 
    multiple scattering diplacement at geometry boundary is available.</LI>
<LI>G4SynchrotronRadiation process is now applicable for all
    charged particles.</LI>
<LI>High energy processes G4GammaConversionToMuons and G4eeToHadrons
    are ready for production.</LI>
<LI>A new model class G4LowEWentzelVIModel is introduced for low-energy
    electron elastic scattering. Low-energy cross-section for water has
    been added for the low-energy Livermore photoelectric model.</LI>
<LI>A new User Interface command to disable production
    thresholds in atomic deexcitation has been introduced:
    <TT>/process/em/deexcitationIgnoreCut true/false</TT>.</LI>
<LI>An alternative set of data files for the simulation of atomic fluorescence
    lines is also provided in this release.</LI>
<LI>In Geant4-DNA physics, added ionisation model from Rudd for
    B, Be, Li and Si ions. An alternative physics constructor
    G4EmDNAPhysics_option1 including the G4LowEWentzelVIModel has been also
    introduced. G4DNAIonisation and G4DNARuddIonisationExtendedModel have been
    updated for G4GenericIon usage.</LI>
<LI>Classes for the simulation of water radiolysis have been introduced for
    Geant4-DNA chemistry.
    See details at <A HREF="http://geant4-dna.org">Geant4-DNA project site</A></LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>In this release, mass width is taken into account in decays of short-lived
    hadrons. Daughter hadrons have dynamical mass according to Breit-Wigner
    distribution.</LI>
<LI>The Fritiof (FTF) model has been significantly improved, resulting in
    closer agreement with thin-target data. 
    Revisions in string fragmentation affect the meson production, and in
    particular the pi-zero fraction of showers. This is largely counteracted
    by other improvements of FTF and an imposed reduction of omega production.
    The overall effects on hadronic observables is found to large cancel 
    in our benchmark hadronic calorimeter setups, but the effect should be
    monitored on experiment setups for key observables including visible
    energy, resolution, longitudinal and lateral size.</LI>
<LI>The fragmentation part of the Quark-Gluon-String (QGS) model has been
    improved significantly.
    This implies that the hadronic showers produced with QGS-based physics
    lists (e.g. QGSP_FTFP_BERT) become wider and longer, and with a lower
    energy response, in closer agreement with the ones produced by FTF. </LI>
<LI>The INCLXX model has been extended up to 15-20 GeV incident energy.</LI>
<LI>Labeling of tracks resulting from muon stopping are added.</LI> 
</UL>

<A NAME="phonon"><B>Phonon Physics</b></A>
<P>The contents of this new physics category were moved into the toolkit
   from the <Code>phonon</Code> extended example.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A new set of processes and utility classes are provided as a framework
    to support propagation of phonons through materials.</LI>
<LI>G4LatticeManager and G4LatticeReader provide access to the solid
    crystal structure parameters (G4LatticeLogical and G4LatticePhysical in
    Materials) read from data files and used by the physics processes.</LI>
<LI>G4PhononPolarization defines an enum to identify the three acoustic
    phonon polarization states supported in this framework.  See
    also <A HREF="#particles"><b>Particles</b></A> below.</LI>
<LI>G4PhononTrackMap is an internal singleton class used by the processes
    to associate additional phonon-specific information (wave number,
    etc.) with each propagating G4Track object in the event.</LI>
<LI>G4VPhononProcess is the abstract base class for the phonon processes,
    and provide some common utility functions.</LI>
<LI>G4PhononDownconversion implements the conversion of high energy
    phonons to pairs of lower energy phonons.</LI>
<LI>G4PhononReflection is a "template" process which will, in the future,
    implement reflection or transmission of phonons at the boundaries of
    crystals.  Currently, phonons at a boundary are absorbed, and an
    associated G4VUserSteppingAction (in the <Code>phonon</Code> example)
    records hits.</LI>
<LI>G4PhononScattering implements the scatting of phonons from one
    polarization state to another due to impurities or defects in the
    crystal lattice.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Generic Biasing</b>
<UL>
<LI>A new class G4BiasingProcessSharedData is introduced, allowing to gather
    information shared by the G4BiasingProcessInterface instances attached
    to the same G4ParticleDefinition (hold by a same G4ProcessManager).</LI>
<LI>Now providing easier access to cross-sections/mean-free-paths of wrapped
    physics processes, making all them up to date at the first call to the
    biasing operator.</LI>
<LI>New examples have been added: <TT>GB03</TT> showing a technique inspired
    by geometry importance biasing, but with some more flexibility;
    <TT>GB04</TT>, an implementation of Bremsstrahlung splitting, using the
    generic biasing classes.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="particles"><B>Particles</B></A>
<UL>
<LI>Ions and isomers are instantiated during the event loop as they become
    necessary. In the previous release 10.0, all ions and isomers were
    instantiated before the event loop.</LI>
<LI>Pre-instantiation of all ions and isomers is still optional via a UI
    command at <TT>PreInit</TT> or <TT>Idle</TT> states.</LI>
<LI>Three new particles corresponding to the polarization states of acoustic
    phonons are provided to support the <A HREF="#phonon">phonon physics</A>
    processes.  These were moved into the toolkit from the <Code>phonon</Code>
    extended example.
    <UL>
    <LI>G4PhononLong: longitudinal (along crystal valley axis) polarization;</LI>
    <LI>G4PhononTransFast: higher-speed transverse polarization;</LI>
    <LI>G4PhononTransSlow: lower-speed transverse polarization.</LI>
    </UL>
</UL>

<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Switched on muon-nuclear by default in all physics lists.</LI>
  <LI>Cut on proton is set to zero, to simulate all recoils from elastic
      scattering, in physics lists using neutron-HP.</LI>
  <LI>The physics lists based on INCLXX use this model for pions, protons and
      neutrons up to 20 GeV, and the string model (FTF or QGS) starting 
      from 15 GeV.</LI>
  <LI>Trying out a new hadron elastic scattering, still in development, in
      the experimental physics-list FTFP_BERT_TRV.</LI>
  <LI>The G4OpticalPhysics constructor has been restructured and UI
      commands have changed. This allows for different particles to have
      specific settings of optical parameters.</LI>
  <LI>New experimental physics lists ShieldingM and NuBeam are introduced.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Visualization</B> and <B>Interfaces</B>
<UL>
<LI><U>Evolution of Qt User Interface</U>
    <UL>
    <LI>The "Scene tree" opens up as soon as the detector is drawn.</LI>
    <LI>An editable "Viewer properties" panel allows one to adjust view
        parameters interactively.</LI>
    <LI>"Picking information" also has its own panel that may be opened
        by the user. Picking has been improved.</LI>
    <LI>The "Scene tree, Help and History" panel may be detached, leaving
        more screen space for the viewers.</LI>
    <LI>The "Output" panel may also be detached.</LI>
    <LI>One may select output by a string match or, in the case of
        multi-threaded mode, by thread.</LI>
    <LI>A "Useful tips" window is available in the viewer panel and comes up
       automatically if no other view has been created.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
<LI>In representing curved surfaces by planar polygons the number of
    "lines per circle" may optionally be reduced to as little as 3 (the
    default is 24) if speed of rendering is the priority.</LI>
<LI><U>New commands</U>
    <UL>
    <LI><TT>/vis/touchable/dump</TT>: dumps attributes of a specific
        touchable (as set by the <TT>/vis/set/touchable</TT> command).</LI>
    <LI><TT>/vis/scene/add/extent</TT>: allows one to add an extent (i.e.,
        coordinate system and range) to a scene. Normally this is done
        automatically by a survey of the geometry, but if you wish to draw
        trajectories without geometry, for example, you may use this command.</LI>
    <LI><TT>/vis/set/textSize</TT>: controls text size on subsequent
        <TT>/vis/scene/add/axes</TT> and <TT>/vis/scene/add/scale</TT> commands.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
<LI><U>Improved commands</U>
    <UL>
    <LI><TT>/vis/scene/add/scale</TT>: one may now add more than one scale
        to a scene.</LI>
    <LI><TT>/vis/scene/add/axes</TT>: one may suppress annotations.</LI>

<H2>5. Expected effects on physics and computing performance</H2>

<B>General</B>
<UL>
<LI>Memory space required per thread is reduced to less than half.
    This reduction does not include the space defined in the users code.</LI>
<LI>We observe up to 10% speedup in several use-cases.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>All internal physics tables are shared between threads, thus
    reducing contribution of electromagnetic physics to total
    memory per thread.</LI>
<LI>Code cleanup providing slight speedup (about a few percent)
    of electromagnetic simulation.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Extensive development in the FTF model has improved significantly
    the agreement between simulation and thin-target data on
    hadron-hadron and hadron-nucleus interactions.
    Small changes are expected in hadronic shower observables
    in the physics lists based on the FTF model (e.g. FTFP_BERT).</LI>
<LI>Improvements in the fragmentation part of the QGS model produce
    now hadronic showers which are more similar to those produced by the
    FTF model.</LI>

        for baryons like Delta++ (uuu), Delta- (ddd) and so on.
        Re-tuned parameters of FTF model (in the class G4FTFParameters) in

        conservation for K-nucleus interactions.</LI>
    <LI>Essential improvement of QGS hadronization. Fragmentation functions of
        quarks and di-quarks are close to Kaidalov's and Shabelskii's ones.
        Ionk's algorithm is inserted for sampling light-cone momentum fraction, z.
        First tuning of fragmentation parameters (further improvements are
