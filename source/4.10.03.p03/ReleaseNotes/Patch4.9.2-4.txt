                 Geant4 9.2 - patch-04 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                            16 September 2010

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.2.p03:

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/cascade:
      o Fix for long-standing problem of energy non conservation in pion-nuclear
        reaction on very light nuclei (in particular He) in G4CascadeInterface.
        The workaround re-samples the interaction in the rare case when an
        unphysical final state with baryon number violation is generated.
    + models/CHIPS:
      o Fix in G4QEnvironment for a rare problem of anomalous event with high
        pT jet observed in ATLAS, identified in a Gamma+A -> X reaction with
        gamma energy of 2 GeV, for which at least one of the secondaries was
        created with too much kinetic energy (up to 90 GeV).
        Addresses problem report #1126 and relates only to 9.2 release series.
      o Fix in G4ChiralInvariantPhaseSpace to catch previously un-handled
        exceptions produced when a 'chipolino' pseudo-particle is produced by
        the model and thrown by Q4QEnvironment::Fragment; handles the case in
        which Q4QEnvironment returns a 90000000 fragment, and converts it to
        a gamma. Addressing problem report #1138.
