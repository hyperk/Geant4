List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.1:

  o Configuration:

      o G4CashKarpRKF45: deleted un-needed duplicate (and unused) instance
        variable already defined in G4MagIntegratorStepper.
      o Some code cleanup.
    + navigation:
      o G4PropagatorInField: changed condition for 'ReEstimationEndPoint'
        in order to better handle very strict parameters of propagation.
        Also added more verbosity in case of error for negative step.
        Fixes rare problem observed in production by ATLAS.  (*)
      o G4PhantomParameterisation: bug fix in GetReplicaNo() to catch
        overflows in X and Y.
        Made CheckVoxelsFillContainer() visible in public interface.
    + solids/BREPS: (*)
      o Fixed bug in G4BREPSolidPolyhedra::DistanceToOut() for cases of
        particle passing the border of two touching surfaces.
      o G4BREPSolidBox: fixed problem in the constructor in definition of
        the side for the normal to surface.
    + solids/specific:
      o In G4ExtrudedSolid::MakeFacets(), now adding triangular facets before
        quadrangular ones, following logic behind G4TessellatedSolid.
        Fixes occasional crashes when defining solids with mixed facets.
        Corrected triangularization of polygon, now correctly handling case
        of concave shapes.
      o Corrected order of arguments in G4Paraboloid constructor.
    + volumes:
      o Fixed problem of double-deletion of rotation matrix in destructor
        of G4AssemblyVolume.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Changed date for patch-01 to release 9.1.

  o Graphics Representations:
    ------------------------
    + HepPolyhedron: fixed bug and improvement in the visualization of
      G4Paraboloid.

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    + G4UItcsh: fixed problem with <Ctl-D> termination for bash users.
    + G4UIQt: some improvements for Qt3, corrections of some bugs.
    + G4UIQt_moc: added versions for QT_MOC_REVISION 28,58 and 59.
 
  o Electromagnetic Processes:
    -------------------------
    + Standard:
      o G4PAIModel, G4PAIPhotonModel: added extra protection to guarantee
        correct usage of the last bin for the table of energy transfers.
        Fixes problem report #995.
      o G4hIonisation, G4ionIonisation, G4ionGasIonisation: fixed
        computation of non-ionizing energy loss: at the last ionization step
        and at energies above 2 MeV for protons.
      o G4eCoulombScatteringModel: using safer numerical espression.
    + Utils:
      o G4EmCorrections: improved CPU by usage of expansions and precalculated
        values of Z^0.23.
      o G4VEnergyLossProcess: fixed list of "collaborative" processes needed
        for sub-cutoff option.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o G4PhotoNuclearCrossSection and G4ElectroNuclearCrossSection: fixed
        wrong return value (was zero instead of pseudo-inf) and commented out 
        extra debug warning. Moved unnecessary inline methods to implementation.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space:
      o Fixed problem of non-reproducibility induced by
        G4QElasticCrossSection.  (*)
      o Reduce memory allocation induced by use std::deque collection in    (*)
        G4QHadron class; temporary workaround by replacing it with std::list.
      o G4ChiralInvariantPhaseSpace: moved some unnecessary inline methods to 
        implementation and fixed non-reproducibility due to difference in 
        initialisation.
      o G4StringChipsInterface: fixed non-reproducibility due to difference in
        initialisation.  (*)
      o Commented out debug printout in G4Quasmon.
      o Fixed compilation warning on SUN/CC compiler in G4QNucleus.
    + models/coherent_elastic:
      o G4DiffuseElastic: removed dependency on other elastic models.
      o G4ElasticHadrNucleusHE: fixed non-reproducibility problem.
        Removed commented part of old code and added more formatting.
      o G4HadronElastic: restored threshold to G4ElasticHadrNucleusHE 
        model at 1 GeV.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + gdml:
      o Fixed vertex referencing for tessellated-solid in G4GDMLSolids.
      o Fixed entity resolution in G4GDMLBase.
      o Fixed naming of convention for external files in G4GDMLStructure.

  o Physics Lists:
    + G4EmExtraPhysics: fixed swapping of synchrotron radiation and mu-nuclear
      activation. Addressing problem report #993.

  o Track:
    -----
    + Added non-ionizing energy loss to EM physics (classes
      G4ParticleChangeForGamma and G4ParticleChangeForLoss).

  o Transportation:
    --------------
    + G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation: allow for clearing the
      state of all chord-finders using G4FieldManagerStore. Assures for
      event reproducibility in case multiple local fields are used.
    + Syncronised files with CVS HEAD.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + extended/electromagnetic/TestEm7:
      o Added PhysListStandardNR PhysList in which G4ScreenedNuclearRecoil
        process is used ("standardNR");
      o Added computation of mean NIEL energy loss.
      o Fixed experimental physics lists if single scattering models are used 
        instead of multiple scattering. Set nuclear stopping flag for ionisation 
        to "false".
    + extended/gdml:
      o Added entity.gdml and materials.xml to demonstrate the ability of
        the parser of resolving entities.
      o Fixed axes.gdml and diamond.gdml according to tessellated-solid
        specifications.
    + extended/medical/DICOM:
      o Fix to not use 'rindex' in DicomHandler class to avoid problems
        on Windows.

 (*) Fixes also included in the patched releases 9.0.p02 and 8.3.p02.
