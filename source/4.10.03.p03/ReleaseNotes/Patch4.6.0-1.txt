                 Geant4 6.0 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           11 February 2004

List of fixes included in this public patch since release 6.0:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Configure:
      o Corrected defaults for shared-libs build.
    + architecture.gmk:
      o Protect OGLFLAGS against containing include path to /usr/include.
        This may cause wrong includes to be picked up.
    + Darwin-g++.gmk:
      o Adopt "g++" as the default as compiler.
      o Corrected procedure for building .dylib shared libs.
        Previous default Linux commands do not work on MacOSX.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + magneticfield:
      o G4UniformMagField: added missing implementation for
        GetConstantFieldValue(). Fixes bug report #575.
    + navigation:
      o Modified G4PropagatorInField::ReEstimateEndpoint() to cope with
        a failure of AccurateAdvance(), by calling it iteratively up maximum
        20 times.
      o Fix in G4PropagatorInField::SetVerboseLevel(): now forwarding the
        verbosity to integration driver.
    + solids/CSG:
      o Converted strong exceptions in warning notifications for rare
        anomalous conditions in DistanceToOut(p,v,..).
      o G4Cons: bug fix in DistanceToIn(p,v) to resolve situations of calls
        to DistanceToOut() for points outside.
    + solids/specific:
      o G4PolyhedraSide: fixed bug in which particles could "leak" out the
        center of a face if inner radius = 0. Fixes problem report #547.
    + volumes:
      o G4AssemblyVolume: fixed initial value for 'numberOfDaughters' of
        imprinted volumes copy-numbers. Fixes problem report #566.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4UnitsTable: corrected signatures to consider 'const G4String&'
      wherever applicable.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4Material: proper STL handling of 'theElementVector'.
    + Fixed problem in destructor of G4SandiaTable.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fixed initialization problems in G4NuclearPropertiesTable:
      o Added initialization of 'indexArray'.
      o Removed internal static member 'theInstance'.

  o Electromagnetic low-energy processes:
    ------------------------------------
    + Fixed memory leaks in G4PenelopeInterpolator and G4PenelopeIonisation.

  o Electromagnetic standard processes:
    ----------------------------------
    + standard:
      o Minor fixes in G4PAIonisation and G4PAIModel.
    + utils:
      o Activated precise range calculation.
      o Added Set methods to G4LossTablemanager to define: binning,
        'maxEnergy' for muon tables, 'maxEnergy' for precise range.
      o Fixed problem in destruction of PAI model.
      o Fixed bug responsible for problems in cross section of
        delta-electron production from muons.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + management:
      o Fix for suspended particles. Solves a problem seen in neutron_hp
        elastic scattering.
    + chiral_inv_phase_space:
      o Porting of experimental interface classes.
      o Provided implementation of missing cases which was cause of 
        crashes in ATLAS production.
    + neutron_hp:
      o Fixed conflict with system variable name.
    + parton_string:
      o Lower bound added to transverse mass distribution, to enable
        diffractive scattering for gammas. Was cause of a crash in ATLAS
        productions.

  o Optical processes:
    -----------------
    + Fix in the initialization of the G4OpBoundaryProcessStatus at the 
      beginning of its DoIt(), now set to "Undefined". This should allow
      a user to correctly get the process flag from the UserSteppingAction()
      through the public function G4OpBoundaryProcess::GetStatus()
      even when the (forced) DoIt() was called when the optical photon
      track was not at a boundary, or when medium1 == medium2.

  o Parameterised processes:
    -----------------------
    + G4FastSimulationVector: use std_pvector:: scope for calls to
      base class. Fixes compilation problem on Intel-icc compiler.

  o Transportation processes:
    ------------------------
    + Fixed a bug in G4UserSpecialCuts related to 'charged-geantino'.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Updated date to run-manager.

  o Track:
    -----
    + G4VParticleChange: removed unnecessary 'const' qualifier to return
      value in GetAccuracyForWarning() and GetAccuracyForException()
      causing noisy compilation warnings on Intel-icc compiler.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + management:
      o Fixed compilation problems on Intel-icc compiler. Added missing
        forward declaration of G4VisStateDependent to G4VisManager. 
    + HepRep:
      o Fixed handling of symbols zcalloc and zcfree of the zlib library
        being called as C++ mangled names. 
      o Renamed zutil.h, zlib.h and zconf.h into HepRep-zutil.h, ... to
        avoid conflicts with those files on Unix systems if /usr/include
        or /usr/local/include is on the include search path.
      o Fixed compilation problems on Intel-icc compiler.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + extended/analysis/A01
      o Fixed physics lists for EM processes.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
