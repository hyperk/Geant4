                 Geant4 8.1 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           27 July 2006

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 8.1:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management
      o Fixed problem in G4Region::ScanVolumeTree() for volume scanning
        related to nested parameterisations.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Code cleanup for G4PrimaryVertex class.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + muons:
      o G4EnergyLossForExtrapolator: fixed misprint in name for method
        EnergyDispersion().
    + utils:
      o Do not clear loss table map in G4LossTableManager to avoid crash
        for activation/desactivation of regime with ion gun.
        Propagating 'RandomStep' flag to processes.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body:
      o Bug fix in QGSC for redefenition of Chipolino.
      o Fixed light Cone Boost bug, causing the error message from vectors.
    + models/coherent_elastic:
      o Fixed problem in rotation of final state which needs to be done in
        PostStep of the process and not at model level.
      o Removed 1 keV limit from G4UHadronElasticProcess.
    + models/radioactive_decay
      o G4NuclearDecayChannel::BetaDecayIt(): make additional check for
        negative sqrt() argument in 'daughtermomentum[1]'.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + Fixed initialisation problem for QBBC_HP
    + Corrected flag for HP regime in G4HadronElasticPhysics() to be 'true'
      for LHEP_HP and QGSP_HP.
    + Added G4NeutronHPElasticData in HP physics lists for hadron elastic
      physics.
    + Added cout of list of processes and models for QBBC.


  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + advanced/composite_calorimeter
      o Updated hadronic physics list to be consistent with validation runs.
    + advanced/lAr_calorimeter
      o Updated hadronic physics list to be consistent with validation runs.
      o Fixed few problems of use of non-initialised variables.
      o Fixed compilation problems on gcc-4.X.
    + advanced/hadrontherapy
      o Corrected hadronic physics list for Precompund model.
    + advanced/radioprotection
      o Added missing inclusion of G4UItcsh.hh inside main().
    + extended/eventgenerator/HepMC
      o Updated physics lists to conform with non-static particles.
    + extended/parallel/ParN02
    + extended/parallel/ParN04
      o Updated physics lists to conform with non-static particles.
