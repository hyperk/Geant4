                 Geant4 8.1 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           10 November 2006

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 8.1.p01:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management
      o Added empty virtual method CheckOverlaps() to G4VPhysicalVolume to
        allow for proper overloading from subclasses. Implementation returns
        always 'false', which is the case for replicas.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Corrected inclusion of CLHEP headers in wrapper files
      G4SystemOfUnits.hh and G4PhysicalConstants.hh.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + standard:
      o Fixed energy non-conservation in G4PAIModel for positrons. Fix also
        concerning 'Tmax' for electrons and positrons: 'Tmax' is defined
        now for each particle independently.
      o Fixed problem of positron zero incident energy in G4eeToTwoGammaModel.
      o Added extra protection inside G4BetheBlochModel.
      o Fixed problems and add comments in the classes prototype Coulomb
        elastic scattering: G4CoulombScattering, G4CoulombScatteringModel,
        G4eCoulombScatteringModel. Set default limit on scattering angle to
        zero.
    + utils:
      o G4VEnergyLossProcess: made LambdaPhysicsVector() method protected.
      o G4ionEffectiveCharge: added protection for NULL pointer to material.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/coherent_elastic:
      o Introduced NaN check inside G4HadronElastic, G4ChargeExchange, and
        G4UHadronElasticProcess.
      o Removed HP data from G4UHadronElasticProcess (it is set in physics
        lists); added low energy threshold of 20 MeV in G4HadronElastic for
        QElastic. For any particle with kinetic energy below 10 KeV, the
        primary particle is returned unchanged and no scattering is sampled.
        This prevents situations of low-energy neutrons scattering forever,
        and reduces precision in computing scattering for low-energy hadrons.
    + models/utils:
      o Reduced warning output from G4Fragment on negative excitation energy;
        a maximum of 10 warnings is printed now.
      o G4Fancy3DNucleus:ChoosePositions(): correctly use std::vector.
        Correction addressing problem report #887 on WIN32/VC8.
      o Removed meaningless 'const' qualifier from return type of method
        G4Fancy3DNucleusHelper().

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fixed bug in G4ParticleDefinition constructor causing not filling quark
      contents when G4VERBOSE is not set.
    + Fixed bug in k2(1770) decay. Addresses problem report #894.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + Get Rid of useless forward declarations in G4MCTEvent and
      G4MCTGenParticle header files. Clearing compilation warnings on
      icc-9.X compilers.

  o Track:
    -----
    + Made G4StepPoint::operator=() inline for optimisation.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + G4HadronElasticPhysics: added explicit inclusions of data headers
      in the header file.

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Linux-icc: updated setup to support Intel icc compiler 9.X series.
    + liblist.c: added .dylib search for list of libraries.
      Addressing problem report #885.
    + architecture.gmk: added variables for commands: echo, cat, cut, sed;
      to be eventually overloaded in system dependent configurations.
      Overloaded variables for WIN32-VC to force usage of the original
      CygWin built-in commands. Use standard 'echo' command for Darwin-g++.
      Replaced system commands with variables defined at architecture level
      in source/GNUmakefile.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + advanced/underground_physics
      o Fixed bug: removed uninitialized 'UserLimitsForXenon'.
    + extended/analysis/AnaEx01
      o Corrected text in README for AIDA setup.
