                 Geant4 8.0 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           10 February 2006

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 8.0:

  o Digits & Hits:
    -------------
    + Added missing methods in G4VDigiCollection and G4TDigiCollection.
      Addresses problem report #786.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + divisions
      o Added missing setting of mother-logical pointer in constructors of
        G4PVDivision. Fixes problem report #829.
      o Added missing checks for illegal constructs of G4PVDivision (NULL
        pointer to mother logical and self-placement).
      o Fixed check for generic construct in G4ParameterisationPolycone and
        G4ParameterisationPolyhedra: allow it for the automatic replicated
        instance.
      o Cache information about axis of division and provided accessor method
        GetDivisionAxis() in G4PVDivision.
    + navigation
      o Addressing problem with convergence in LocateIntersectionPoint()
        of G4PropagatorInField. The problem, identified by Atlas, was
        observed when requesting high precision, i.e. small values of
        eps_min/max, delta_one_step, due to need for small delta_intersection.
        Increased maximum iterations (from 100 to 10000) until correct
        information can be return an Exception is thrown in case of too many
        iterations; a warning is thrown in case over 1000 iterations.
    + solids/BREPS
      o Use explicit 'HepGeom' namespace for 'Identity', to allow for
        porting on Windows/VC++ when using CLHEP-2.0.X.
    + solids/CSG
      o G4Sphere: fixed bug in DistanceToOut() for theta intersections.
        Fixes problem report #830.
    + solids/specific
      o Fixed visibility of soft edges for visualization of twisted solids.
      o G4TwistedTubs and G4VTwistedFaceted::CreatePolyhedron(): changed
        parameterised polyhedron mesh approximation in terms of
        G4Polyhedron::GetNumberOfRotationSteps().
      o Fixes in G4EllipticalCone:
        - Changed GetPointOnSurface(), which was not uniform in endcaps.
        - Bug fix in Inside(), which was not correct for the elliptic mantel.
          Made test similar as in G4EllipticTube.
        - Several fixes in DistanceToIn/Out() resolving problems of looping
          events.
    + volumes
      o G4AssemblyVolume: fixed initialisation of names for placed volumes
        which was corrupted after migration to <sstream> as side effect.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Bug fix for G4ParticleDefinition, was causing improper behavior of
      GetAtomicNumber() method for ions. Fixes problem report #827.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + standard:
      o Fix in G4PolarizedComptonScattering, returning PostStepDoIt()
        for G4ComptonScattering52. Fixes problem report #478.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + management:
      o G4HadronicProcess: fixed problem report #611. Problems caused when
        hadronic interactions reset stopButAlive particle to Alive.
      o Added diagnostics when hadronic exceptions occur in G4HadronicProcess
        and G4EnergyRangeManager.
    + models/binary_cascade:
      o Fixed problem report #794. Projectile nucleus needs to be centered.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body:
      o Fixed trivial compilation warning.
    + models/de_excitation:
      o G4NuclearLevelManager: print a warning if no data file is present.
        Addressed problem report #814.
      o G4ParaFissionModel: fix for compilation error, following problem
        report #817.
    + models/neutron_hp:
      o Fixes core dump observed when neutron energy is close to 20 MeV.
    + models/radioactive_decay
      o G4NuclearDecayChannel::BetaDecayIt(): check for negative sqrt()
        argument in 'daughtermomentum[1]'. Fixes problem report #822.
    + stopping:
      o Set process type to be 'fHadronic'. Was not set previously.
    + util:
      o G4ReactionDynamics: added array bounds protection in TwoCluster().

  o Processes cuts:
    --------------
    + Fix in G4VRangeToEnergyConverter::Convert() to recalculate the energy
      loss table if new elements are added. Fixes problem report #831.

  o Track:
    -----
    + G4ParticleChangeForRadDecay is now derived from G4ParticleChangeForDecay.

  o Transportation:
    --------------
    + G4Transportation: the particle's charge is now taken from the dynamic
      particle, so that it can take into account changes from the interaction
      of an ion with matter (eg stripping e-).
    + Corrected problem with suspended tracks, addressing problem report #802.
      Added StartTracking() method which takes over responsibility to clear
      the state for a new track, and to message other relevant component to
      clear their state.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + management:
      o Fixed bug that omits geometry volumes from file-based visualization
        drivers for first /run/beamOn.
      o Added friend status for ray-tracer.
    + RayTracer:
      o Fix behavior of messengers when RayTracerX is used.
      o Allow for multiple ray tracers.
      o Separated out the original ray tracer to be used by viewers.

  o Data:
    ----
    + New data set for high-precision neutron processes G4NDL-3.8
      o Added Gadorinium data (source ENDF/B-VI).
      o Replaced: Inelastic/CrossSection/17_nat_Chlorine and
        Inelastic/F10/28_62_Nickel (source ENDF/B-VI).
      o Removed: Inelastic/CrossSection/32_70|72|73|74|76_Germanium

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + extended/electromagnetic/TestEm7
      o Trivial fix of memory leak.
    + extended/medical/GammaTherapy
      o Substituted PreciseRange with CSDARange.
