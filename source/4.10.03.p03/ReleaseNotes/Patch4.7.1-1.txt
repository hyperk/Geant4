List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 7.1:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Excluded usage of unnecessary 'ranlib' at creation of the libraries
      for WIN32-VC system. Fixes an observed problem of debug-symbols
      corruption.
    + Synchronized CXXFLAGS warning options of WIN32-g++ with Linux-g++.
    + Fixed Configure script for --incflags and --ldflags options.

  o Event:
    -----
    + Corrected typo in printout in G4GeneralParticleMessenger.
      Addresses problem report #786.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + navigation
      o G4DrawVoxels: removed unnecessary 'panic' message in
        ComputeVoxelPolyhedra() and some code cleanup.
    + solids/BREPS
      o Fixed problem of double-deletion in G4BREPSolidPolyhedra and
        G4BREPSolidPCone destructors.
    + solids/CSG
      o Fixed bug in G4Sphere::DistanceToOut(p,v): added check for
        intersection with double cone.
      o Fixed bug in G4Para::DistanceToOut(p,v) for the case v.x()<0.
        Following problem report from user posted on Hypernews (#452).
      o Improved implementation for DistanceToIn/Out() in G4Torus to make use
        of G4JTPolynomialSolver for precise calculation of the intersections.
    + solids/specific:
      o Fixed compilation warning on WIN32-VC for G4VSurface.cc.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4Allocator: initialise esplicitely data in copy-ctor.
    + G4AllocatorPool: added default dummy argument to ctor to allow for
      default-ctor

  o Parameterisations:
    -----------------
    + Added overflow protection in method GenerateRadius() for
      GFlashHomoShowerParamterisation in the 'gflash' module.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fix to prohibit creation of ions in 'PreInit' state to make sure
      that proper processes will be attached to the ions.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + high-energy:
      o Fix a misprint in G4BetheBlochNoDeltaModel and minor cleanup.
    + muons:
      o In all energy loss models return protection against the case
        tmin>tmax (fixes bug report).
      o Fix angular distributions of secondaries and 4-momentum balance
        in G4MuBremsstrahlungModel and G4MuPairProductionModel.
      o Added protection in G4MuPairProductionModel needed for sampling
        of pair energy in the case of low cuts.
    + standard:
      o In all energy loss models return protection against the case
        tmin>tmax (fixes bug report).
      o Fix for initialisation of G4eBremsstrahlungModel.
      o Fix a bug in calculation of chemical correction in G4BraggIonModel
        and fix in G4BraggModel for problem observed when increasing
        precision using standard model and chemical effect.
    + utils:
      o G4VEnergyLossProcess: return number protections against numerical
        imprecision, which were used in version 7.0 and removed in 7.1
        (fixes bug report)
      o Set default lambdaFactor to 0.8 for integral mode (improvement in
        CPU performance for low cuts).
      o G4VEmProcess: use integral mode only for charged particles.
      o G4EmModelManager: fix a cut calculation for the e+e- pair
        production physics process.
      o G4VMultipleScattering: fixed error in a protection in
        GetContinuousStepLimit().
    + xrays:
      o Changed variable name 'MeanNumPhotons' to 'MeanNumberOfPhotons' in
        G4Scintillation and G4Cerenkov to conform with the documentation in
        the Application Developers Guide.
      o Added G4ProcessType identifier to all processes constructors.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + management:
      o Correctly set the type of a hadronic process.
        Fixes problem report #744.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body:
      o Memory leak fix for nuclear mass management in G4QPDGCode to use
        G4 masses of nuclear fragments.
    + models/low_energy:
      o Fix in elastic scattering for the case of target hydrogen: use
        relativistic kinematic for the generation of the final state.
        Fix tested in HARP.
    + stopping:
      o Fixed bug in time of e- produced in bound decay of mu-.
