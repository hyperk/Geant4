                 Geant4 7.0 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                           23 February 2005

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 7.0:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Fix in Configure script for unnecessary check on setting of
      CLHEP_BASE_DIR to /usr, /usr/local on Linux platforms.

  o Event:
    -----
    + Fixed bug on binning in G4SPSRandomGenerator.
    + Fixed reset of histogram energy limits in G4SPSEneDistribution.
    + Restored the inheritance to G4VPrimaryGenerator for the
      G4GeneralParticleSource class.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + solids/specific:
      o Use new polynom approximations based on new solver based on
        Jenkins-Traub algorithm, for twisted-box and twisted-trap.
      o Fixed bug in the usage of 'fmod' and adopt special treatment for
        'parallel' events in G4TwistedBoxSide and G4TwistedTrapSide.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Added polynom-solver class G4JTPolynomialSolver implementing the
      Jenkins-Traub algorithm for real polynomial root finding. To be used
      by the twisted-trap shape for precise computation of intersections.

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    + Minor fix in GNUmakefiles to remove unnecessary definition of G4TMPDIR.

  o Parameterisations:
    -----------------
    + Fix in GFlashHitMaker for treatment of detector sensitivity in the
      'gflash' module.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fix in G4UnknownParticle to make it non-static, in order to avoid
      unnecessary linking without its definition in the physics list.

  o Electromagnetic processes:
    -------------------------
    + standard:
      o Fix in UniversalFluctuation: setting proper constants for probLim 
        and minimum energy-loss, to improve simulation of energy loss in
        thin absorbers.
      o Fix in MultipleScattering for function SetSamplez().
      o Add extra protection to G4PAIModel to fix cases of NaN observed
        in production for ALICE. 
    + utils:
      o Bug fix to avoid crash in the inactivation of e- ionisation.
      o Added protection on the value of effective charge to ensure energy
        loss for low energy ions.
      o Fixing initialisation problem for ion beam observed in CMS.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body:
      o Fixed problem of inconsistency between masses of hadrons and nuclear
        fragments and masses defined in Geant4. Conversion of the CHIPS hadrons
        to Geant4  secondaries uses now a kinetic energy of the particle, so
        Geant4 automatically puts particles on the mass shell.
      o Complete usage of the existing nuclear mass approximation of Geant4
        [including M(Z,N)_G4>m_p*Z+m_n*N].
      o Improvement in G4QEnvironmemt in the usage of FinalStateInteraction
        A few cases of the secondary particles below mass shell have been
        corrected. 

  o Management of processes:
    -----------------------
    + Fix in G4ProcessManager to correct ordering of processes.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Fix in G4RunManager and G4RunManagerKernel to correctly reset static
      pointers in the case when RunManager is deleted.
    + Updated date to run-manager.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + HepRep: minor fix for compilation problem on the obsolete gcc-2.95.2.

  o Physics lists:
    -------------
    + hadronic:
      o Fixed compilation problems on gcc-3.4.X compiler series:
        Added explicit 'typename' keywords to template class declarations.
        Use 'this' pointer to access data-members of base class for
        unqualified names in physics-lists inline definitions.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm1
      o HistoManager: added protection for the creation of the analysis
        factory. File extension is fileType.
      o HistoMessenger: new command 'setFileOption'.
    + electromagnetic/TestEm3
      o Fix in SteppingAction to correct the energy flow.
      o Added new macros linac.mac and geant3/linac.dat.
    + novice/N02
      o PhysicsList: added usage of G4StepLimiter (as commented line).
    + novice/N03
      o Fix in SteppingAction: sum stepLength of charged particle even
        if edep=0.
