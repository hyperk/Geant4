                 Geant4 5.1 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                            19 May 2003

List of fixes included in this public patch to release 5.1:

  o Electromagnetic processes (standard):
    ------------------------------------
  + muons:
    - Commented out debug printout in G4MuPairProduction.

  o Geometry:
    --------
  + solids/Boolean:
    - Added set/get methods for scale precision in G4ReflectionFactory.
  + volumes:
    - G4PropagatorInField.cc: fix in ComputeStep() to avoid step computation
      if proposed step length is too small. Fixes problem noticed in release
      5.1 and occasionally appearing as "Invalid Enum in [solid-type]", also
      registered as problem report #485.

  o Hadronic processes:
    ------------------
  + models/generator/kinetic_model
    o G4BinaryCascade: fix to cure infinite loop observed in inelastic
      scattering of hydrogen.

  o Run:
    ---
  - G4RunManager: fixed behavior of function DefineWorldVolume()
    to properly reset navigation history and optimisation in case the
    topology of the geometry has changed between runs. Now only a single
    call to DefineWorldVolume() is necessary when changing the geometry.
    Fixes also problem report #481.
    o Added new boolean argument (default set to TRUE) to specify if
      topology has changed.
    o Forced open/close geometry in method ResetNavigator() to properly
      reset G4Navigator status and remove old optimisations.

  o Examples:
    --------
    - novice/N04
      o Corrected printout.
    - extended/electromagnetic - TestEm1, TestEm2, TestEm3
      o Simplified mechanism for updating geometries between runs,
        according to changes in G4RunManager::DefineWorldVolume().

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
