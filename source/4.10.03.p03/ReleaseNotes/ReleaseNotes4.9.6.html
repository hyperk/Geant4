<H2>4. New Developments and Capabilities </H2>

<B>General</B>
<UL>
<LI>Full event reproducibility is  provided in simulations with most physics
    lists; this  allows  to restart a simulation from an intermediate event
    and obtain exactly the same results, if the user specifies or restores
    the status of the pseudo random generator  at the beginning of the event.
    This strict event reproducibility is achieved in all physics models, with
    two exceptions: 
    CHIPS stopping and neutron HP. This means that event reproducibility is
    valid for the  majority of the physics lists, including FTFP_BERT,
    QGSP_BERT and QGSP_FTFP_BERT.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Geometry</B>
<UL>
<LI>A new optimized implementation of G4TessellatedSolid  provides
    substantial CPU performance boost and reduced memory
    footprint. Scaling of CPU time with increased complexity (number of facets)
    of the shapes being defined or imported.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Materials</B>
<UL>
<LI>For all elements, a vector of G4Isotopes is always created using abundance
    values from NIST (in previous Geant4 versions, the vector of isotopes was
    created only for NIST materials). As a result it is no longer needed to
    define natural composition of isotopes in the user code.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>WentzelVI multiple scattering model is used by default in all EM physics
    lists. For electrons and positrons the WentzelVI model is used only above
    100 MeV.
    This was done to provide more accurate simulation both small and large
    angles of high energy charged particles.</LI>
<LI>Sampling of multiple scattering  is performed AlongStep, before the
    sampling of energy loss (previously multiple scattering was sampled
    PostStep, after the energy loss). The physics performance is unchanged.</LI>
<LI>New processes for microdosimetry in Silicon for electrons, protons and
    ions (G4MuElecElastic, G4MuElecInelastic) and corresponding models
    (G4MuElecElasticModel, G4MuElecInelasticModel).</LI>
<LI>New Compton scattering model (G4LowEPComptonModel) along with specific
    Physics builder (G4EmLowEPPhysics).</LI>
<LI>New builder selects the most accurate models now available for each
    process; this  is G4EmStandardPhysics_option4. Models from both standard
    and low-energy options are used.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Hadronic processes now trigger re-sampling of the interaction if
    energy/momentum non-conservation limits are exceeded. A warning message
    is printed if this occurs.</LI>
<LI>New hadron stopping models G4PiMinusAbsorptionBertini,
    G4KaonMinusAbsorptionBertini, G4SigmaMinusAbsorptionBertini,
    G4AntiProtonAbsorptionFritiof, and G4AntiSigmaPlusAbsorptionFritiof
    are added. </LI>
<LI>New total cross section sets based on SAID data-base are added.
    (They are used for proton, neutron and pion cross-sections on hydrogen
    in majority of physics lists.)</LI>
<LI>A new option in the nuclear de-excitation module allows
    to ignore Doppler broadening for long lived meta-stable isotopes and
    provide instead decay at rest. This new feature is activated by the
    environment variable 
  <IT>G4AddTimeLimitToPhotonEvaporation</IT>
  . If
    this environment variable is set the momentum balance of the
    de-excitation is broken and energy balance is respected.</LI>
<LI>A new electro-nuclear interaction model, G4ElectroVDNuclearModel,
    was created. It is based on the CHIPS total cross sections, with final
    state modeling using the Bertini cascade and FTFP.</LI>
<LI>The INCL cascade model (INCL++) was updated and can now handle
    heavy-ion collisions.</LI>
<LI>HTML files describing hadronic processes, models and cross-sections can
    be printed by invoking the ProcessDescription(), ModelDescription()
    and CrossSectionDescription() methods, respectively.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
<LI>The model of multiple scattering for electrons and positrons is changed
    in all physics lists for HEP applications. Introduced the WentzelVI
    model for multiple scattering of e+ and e- above 100 MeV. Below 100 MeV
    the Urban95 model is used in the main physics lists (whereas Urban93
    is used in EMV or EMX).</LI>
<LI>Relativistic gamma conversion model in used in all physics
    constructors above 80 GeV.</LI>
<LI>New EM physics constructor G4EmStandardPhysics_option4  selects the
    most accurate models for each EM process. It  combines models from
    standard and low-energy sub-packages.</LI>
<LI>New model for lepton-nuclear interactions using Bertini and
    Fritiof/Pre-compound has been introduced in most physics list.
    Only LHEP- and CHIPS-based physics lists  still use the
    (deprecated) CHIPS model for handling lepton-nuclear interactions.</LI>
<LI>Introduced Bertini model for
    nuclear capture at rest of pi-, K-, Sigma-, Xi- and Omega- in most
    physics lists. 
    Also use Fritiof/Pre-compound model for anti-proton, anti-Sigma+
    and light anti-nucleus capture at rest in the same physics lists.
    Only LHEP- and CHIPS-based physics lists are still using the
    (deprecated) CHIPS model for handling nuclear capture at rest.</LI>
<LI>CHIPS elastic and inelastic cross-sections for protons, neutrons, pions,
    kaons, hyperons and anti-baryons have been extracted and moved to the
    default module. They can now be selected individually for use in physics
    lists.</LI>
<LI>Barashenkov-Glauber-Gribov nucleon-nucleus inelastic cross sections
    are now used in most physics lists instead of Axen-Wellisch 
    proton-nucleus and Laidlaw-Wellisch neutron-nucleus inelastic
    cross sections.</LI>
<LI>Glauber-Gribov nucleus-nucleus inelastic cross sections are now used
    in most physics lists instead of Shen (which in turn replaced Tripathi)
    cross sections.</LI>
<LI>The new physics list FTFP_BERT_HP has been created: it is similar to
    FTFP_BERT, but using HP for low-energy neutrons.</LI>
<LI>Four new physics lists have been created: QGSP_BERT_95,
    QGSP_FTFP_BERT_95, QGSP_BERT_95XS and QGSP_FTFP_BERT_95XS.
    The "95" variants have the same physics models and cross sections
    as QGSP_BERT and QGSP_FTFP_BERT, respectively, in Geant4 version 9.5.
    The "95XS" variants have the same cross sections as QGSP_BERT and
    QGSP_FTFP_BERT, respectively, in Geant4 version 9.5, whereas the
    physics models are the same as in Geant4 version 9.6.
    These physics lists, which have been created for "backward compatibility"
    with the production physics lists used by the experiments, are
    deprecated and will be removed in Geant4 10.
    FTFP_BERT remains the recommended physics list for high-energy
    applications.</LI>
</UL>

<p><B>Visualization</B> and <B>Interfaces</B> </p>
<UL>
<LI>/vis/set/colour, lineWidth, textColour, textLayout - new commands to set
    view details.</LI>
<LI>/vis/scene/add/arrow, arrow2D, line, line2D, logo2D, text2D, date,
    frame - new commands to add content to views.</LI>
<LI>/vis/scene/activateModel - new command to control trajectory and hit
    modeling.</LI>
<LI>/vis/viewer/save, copyViewFrom - new commands to save view parameters
    and copy them from one view to another.</LI>
<LI>Improved OpenGL rendering speed through major re-design of scene and
    transient processing. Use new command /vis/ogl/set/eventsDrawInterval
    to get even more speed when accumulating multiple events.</LI>
<LI>/vis/scene/add/userAction now supports multiple user vis actions.
    Where previously one could only have a single user vis action, one can
    now register any number of such actions. Each action gets a specific name,
    and each can be assigned to any selected scene.</LI>
<LI>Added Event ID to trajectory attributes so that in scenes that contain
    more than one event, one can tell which trajectory came from which event.</LI>
<LI>Improved Qt interface and viewer.</LI>
<LI>Improved handling of text.</LI>
<LI>Added new OpenInventor option: /vis/open OIXE (in addition to the
    previous option, /vis/open OIX). Provides many new capabilities such
    as ability to set viewpoints and to fly along a trajectory path.
    This is an excellent viewer selection for accelerator studies or other
    situations in which it can otherwise be difficult to set appropriate
    views.</LI>

<H2>5. Expected effects on physics and computing performance</H2>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Compared with Geant4 9.5.p02 a minor speedup of simulation of EM showers
    (2-3%) in calorimeters is expected, also about factor 2 speedup of EM
    initialisation.</LI> 
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>The main change on hadronic showers in Geant4 9.6 is their lateral
    profile: showers are wider in Iron and Copper, and narrower in
    heavier absorbers, like Tungsten and Lead.
<LI>Similar CPU speed for simulation of hadronic showers as in
    Geant4 9.5.p02.</LI>

        Allow photons to be absorbed via dibaryon (quasideuteron) excitation.
        In generateSCMfinalState(), defer "particles.resize()" action until
        after final-state properties have been validated. In case no final

    <LI>EM physics builders and options:

    <LI>In all EM builders use the same instances of the Bremsstrahlung and
        e+/e- pair production processes for each particle/antiparticle pair.
        As a result, mu+ and mu- share one instance of each process. Pi+ 
        and pi- share a different instance of each process.  The same occurs
        for K+ and K-, and for proton and antiproton.
        Expect reduction of memory required for physics tables and
        initialisation time for EM physics.</LI>
    <LI>In all EM builders use WentzelVI multiple scattering model for e+-
        above 100 MeV; build transport mean free path for He3 and He4, do not
        build for all other ions and heavy hadrons.</LI>
    <LI>New builder G4EmStandardPhysics_option, combining standard and
        low-energy physics configuration as best combination.
        Added "opt4" to G4PhysListFactory.</LI>
    <LI>Modified method of instantiation of multiple scattering: the same
        process instance is used by mu+ and mu-; 
        Note: different instances are still used for  pi+, pi-, K+, K-, proton
        and antiprotons. Separate processes are needed to enable the different
        internal transport cross-section tables.
        For all others particles one (extra) process instance is used and no table 
        is built.</LI>
    <LI>Use the WentzelVI model for e+ and e- above 100 MeV in all standard
        builders for HEP use cases (Opt0, Opt1, Opt2).  This is coupled with
        single Coulomb scattering using G4eCoulombScattering models.

        <LI>/vis/scene/add/scale - default size is now computed automatically.</LI>
        </UL></LI>
    <LI>Extended G4VisManager to support multiple user vis actions.
        Where previously one could only have a single user vis action, one can
        now register any number of such actions. Each action gets a specific
        name, and each can be assigned to any selected scenes.
        See the help system or user guide for details:
        /vis/scene/add/userAction.</LI>
    <LI>Added Event ID to trajectory attributes so that in scenes that contain
        more than one event, one can tell which trajectory came from which
        event.</LI>
    <LI>Removed creation date from EPS files (so that one can more easily use
        diff to tell that two files have the same graphics).</LI>
    <LI>Implemented 'BeginDraw/EndDraw' and 'BeginDraw2D/EndDraw2D'.
        This forces all thus-bracketed Draw messages to have the same
        transformation. If an attempt to change the transformation is detected,
        a fatal exception is raised.</LI>

    <LI>Marker size bug fix.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed Ubuntu warnings about ignoring return value of system call.</LI>
    <LI>Removed several instances of code duplication,
        unnecessary screen refreshing, incorrect buffer switching
        (necessitating extra refreshing), variable shadowing, etc.</LI>
    <LI>Removed #ifdef G4VIS... from header files.</LI>
    <LI>Protected against use of 2D primitives in viewers that can not handle
        these.</LI>
    <LI>Improved handling of parallel worlds (some worlds had been missing from redraws).</LI>
    <LI>Added SetBaseFullPVPath(). The base full path is the full path of the
        top physical volume (actually the full path of the mother of the top
        physical volume), so that even if a user issues
        '/vis/drawVolume sub-detector', the full path includes the base full
        path, i.e., the full path up to the world volume.</LI>
     <LI>G4ModelingParameters: added VisAttributesModifiers, enums and a nested
        class for communicating a modification to the vis attributes for a
        specific touchable defined by PVNameCopyNoPath, to be used by new
        commands set, '/vis/touchable/set/...'.</LI>
