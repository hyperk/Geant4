List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.2:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + Configure script: corrected handling of G4LEDATA and G4LEVELGAMMADATA
      paths in generated configuration scripts.
      Addresses problem report #1037 and #1039.
    + common.gmk, globlib.gmk source/GNUmakefile: remove moc sources in clean
      targets.
    + Linux-g++.gmk: simplified Qt setup to conform to standard Qt installation.
    + Added -lXi to X11LIBS for Linux-g++, Linux-icc and WIN32-g++
      configurations, required for correct linkage with OpenInventor Coin3D
      libraries.

  o Digits_Hits:
    -----------
    + Fixed incorrect volume size for cylindrical parameterized volume used
      in various scorers.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + navigation:
      o Fixed problem in G4BrentLocator::EstimateIntersectionPoint() responsible
        for rare cases of negative steps.
      o Added G4RegularNavigationHelper class, used by G4RegularNavigation for
        counting the number of step lengths in each voxel of the regular
        structure. Forgotten inclusion in 9.2.
      o Some code cleanup...
    + solids/specific:
      o Fix in G4Paraboloid::DistanceToOut(p,v,..) for the computation of
        normal to surface; added missing normalisation to unit, following
        remark in the Geometry Forum Hypernews posting #953.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Correction in management/GNUmakefile to CPPFLAGS, adding G4RF_DEBUG
      in case enabled.
    + Changed date for patch-01 to release 9.2.

  o Low-energy Electromagnetic Processes:
    ------------------------------------
    + Suppressed warning message in Penelope PhotoElectric process
      (G4PenelopePhotoElectric and G4PenelopePhotoElectricModel) from
      G4AtomicTransitionManager appearing for some elements (Oxygen, Fluorine).
    + Corrected energy limits in G4CrossSectionIonisationBornPartial.
    + Added proton case in G4CrossSectionExcitationMillerGreenPartial
      and added protection for water excitation energy.
    + Added 'kill particle without total energy deposit' feature for
      DNA charge change processes.
    + Added protections against FPE in G4hLowEnergyLoss.
    + Fixes problem report 953 (also report in Hypernews EM forum #893).
    + Fixed bug for ICRU73 ion model. 

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4MaterialStoppingICRU73: added 4 missing materials from ICRU'73.
    + G4SimpleMaterialStoppingICRU73: fixed typo in density of Mo. 

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o Improvements for clearing of memory at end of application:
        + G4CrossSectionDataStore: added Clean() method; constructor and
          destructor no longer inline; added destruction of data sets;
          use std::vector instead of flat arrays.
        + G4CrossSectionDataSetRegistry: new singleton to keep pointers to
          cross-section data sets.
        + G4VCrossSectiondataSet: constructor and detructor no longer inline;
          added registration/deregistration mechanism.
    + management:
      o G4HadronicProcessStore: activated destruction of processes at
        application closure; added Clean() method and cleanup of model and
        cross section stores.
    + models/cascade:
      o Corrected absorption coefficient to be set to 1.0 instead of 0.2
        inside G4CascadSpecialFunctions. Small differences are observed for
        calorimeter observables in Bertini physics-lists, resulting in slightly
        wider lateral shower shapes.
    + models/chiral_inv_phase_space/interface
      o Added de-registration in destructor of G4QCaptureAtRest.
      o Added string decay destruction to G4ElectroNuclearReaction.
    + models/de_excitation:
      o Added smearing of Coloumb barriers for d, t, he3 and alpha particles.
      o Fix in G4FissionProbability for computation of EmissionProbability();
        returned value was wrong due to missing parenthesis in the
        implementation of the formula.
      o Fix to substitute 'hbar_Plank' with 'hbarc' in G4EvaporationProbability.
      o Fixed leaks in singleton classes in the util module.
      o Corrected some inlining of constructors/destructors for base classes
        and usage of virtual specification.
    + models/management:
      o G4HadronicInteractionRegistry: modified to conform to singleton
        definition.
      o G4HadronicInteraction, G4InelasticInteraction: made constructor,
        destructor and some other methods not inline.
    + models/photolepton_hadron/muon_nuclear
      o Added de-registration of G4MuNuclearInteraction process.
    + models/pre_equilibrium:
      o G4PreCompoundIon: fixed probability of light ion emission.
      o G4PreCompoundXXX: added decrease of Coulomb barrier for d, t, a, he3.
      o Some cleanup of comments and formatting...
    + stopping:
      o Activated registration/de-registration for all LHEP processes.
    + util:
      o G4StableIsotopes: filled in missing isotope names.

  o Generic Processes:
    -----------------
    + Optical:
      o Fix to G4OpBoundaryProcess to address problem report #1040.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + ascii:
      o Fix in delta theta for handling of G4Sphere, and renaming 'phiTotal'
        to 'phiDelta' for the relevant solids in G4tgbVolume implementation.
      o Bug fix in definition of delta angle for all solids with section in
        Phi in G4tgbVolume. Take into consideration tolerance.
    + gdml:
      o Fixed association of entities in nested loops for solids and materials.
      o Strip off white spaces from names G4GDMLWrite::GenerateName(), to avoid
        parsing problems in imported files.
      o Corrected treatment of brackets and indeces for matrices in
        G4GDMLEvaluator. Fixes problem report #1048.
      o Fix in G4GDMLStructure class for missing caching of auxiliary
        information from child modules, causing auxiliary information defined
        within separated modules to get lost and therefore not assigned to
        volumes. Fixes problem report #1049.
      o Changed post-fix"_refl" to "_PV" for placements made through the
        reflection-factory.
      o Added possibility to check overlaps by activating/de-activating the
        built-in surface check for placement and parameterised volumes.
        By default the overlap check is off. To activate it, use call to the
        parser 'SetOverlapCheck(true)' before reading the GDML file.
        Required for resolving overlap issues fixed above. 

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fixed values of masses for light ions.
    + Optimised G4IonTable::IsIon() implementation for usage of strings.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + G4HadronInelasticQBBC: use G4StringChipsParticleLevelInterface instead
      of obsolete G4StringChipsInterface.
    + G4MiscLHEPBuilder: create processes dynamically for proper deletion at
      the end of job.

  o Tracking:
    --------
    + Fixed issue in G4SteppingManager for the special cases of skipping voxel
      boundaries in G4RegularNavigation.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + Fixed problem in ratio and geometry on X/Xm/Qt/Win32 viewers.
      Now possible to pass XString like 400x600-0+0 to viewers, set position
      and location.
    + Corrected use of G4DEBUG with G4DEBUG_VIS_OGL in OpenGL-Qt code.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + advanced/brachytherapy:
      o Fixed compilation errors and warnings when G4ANALYSIS_USE is not set.
    + advanced/composite_calorimeter:
      o Fixed compilation warnings in CCalRunAction and CCalEndOfEventAction.
    + advanced/hadrontherapy:
      o Fixed a compilation warnings in HIIonLEP.
    + advanced/human_phantom:
      o Migrated GDML read setup to use embedded GDML reader as in Geant4 9.2.
      o Corrected URL for standard location of schema in all GDML files.
      o Use "OrganPos" and "OrganRot" as names for organs's transformations in
        ORNL files, as implied by code.
      o Fixed 'solids' tag in ORNLLeftLegBone.gdml files for male and female.
      o Fixed compilation warnings and updated README.
    + advanced/microbeam:
      o Correction in MicrobeamEMField to use logical '&&', not bit '&' in
        conditional statements.
    + advanced/nanobeam:
      o Correction in TabulatedField3D to use logical '&&', not bit '&' in
        conditional statements.
    + extended/medical/DICOM:
      o Added report on dose per voxel.
      o Fixed use pf class G4RegularNavigationHistory for counting of step
        lengths in voxels of the regular structure; forgotten inclusion in
        release 9.2.
    + extended/persistency/gdml/G02:
      o Guarded usage of G4UITCSH with G4UI_USE_TCSH flag, to allow for
        compilation on Windows.
      o Added visualization properties for world volume in DetectorConstruction
        to avoid run-time warning.
      o Corrected loading of default geometry with assembly, resolving some
        overlaps introduced by mistake.
