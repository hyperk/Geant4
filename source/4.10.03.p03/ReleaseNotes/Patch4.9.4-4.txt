                 Geant4 9.4 - patch-04 Release Notes
                 -----------------------------------

                                                            13 April 2012

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.4.p03:

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + Magnetic Field:
      o G4FieldTrack: added inline method to set the Rest Mass. Needed in
        order to reset this and keep reuse the same G4FieldTrack in a
        client across tracks.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4Pow: reduced vector for factorial from 512 to 170 (result should be
      below DBL_MAX). Fixed computation of log(factorial).
      Added protection in powN() method for high exponent values.
    + Changed date for patch-04 to release 9.4.

  o Electromagnetic Processes:
    -------------------------
    + Standard:
      o G4UrbanMscModel92, G4UrbanMscModel93, G4UrbanMscModel95: added
        protection against big scattering angles for e+- (E > 20 MeV); the
        protection cuts tail of scattering angles to avoid artificial
        scattering of high energy e+-.
      o G4WentzelVIModel: fixed algorithm for sampling of single scattering 
        along step.
      o G4WentzelOKandVIxSection: fixed incorrect angular limit for protons.
        Fixed screening function for low Z materials.
      o G4UniversalFluctuation: fixed sampling at small steps (below 10 um)
        in heavy media about shift in range of 3 MeV muons.
      o G4eCoulombScatteringModel: fixed initialisation of base class data
        in method SetLowEnergyLimit(). Fixed cross-section in compounds.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + models/CHIPS:
      o G4QCaptureAtRest: added check on 4-momentum balance for violations
        of more than 2 GeV; repeat sampling again. Check baryon number of
        final state and take into account nuclear recoil at rest which is
        not produced as a final particle.

  o Track:
    -----
    + Fix to reset 'RestMass' in G4FieldTrackUpdator::Update() method
      as it is used to initialise each track by ParallelWorldScoringProcess.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
