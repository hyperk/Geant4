List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 9.6.p02:

  o Configuration:
    -------------

      of free blocks in a Root file; addressing problem report #1523.
      Fixed failure in writing empty ntuples (in tools/wroot/basket).
    + Fix in G4RootAnalysisManager::WriteOnAscii().
      Addressing problem report report #1473.

  o Digits_Hits:
    -----------
    + Fixed angle factor in G4PSSphereSurfaceFlux to keep it always
      positive. Addressing problem report #1479.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management:
      o Fix to G4VSolid::EstimateCubicVolume() to make proper use of specified
        accuracy. Addressing problem report #1493.

      o Correctly initialise fSPhi to zero in G4Sphere constructor.
    + solids/specific:
      o Fix in G4SurfaceVoxelizer affecting tessellated-solid (and
        extruded-solid) for wrong computation of DistanceToIn(p,v) for
        points outside, when optimisation is active.
      o Fix in G4TessellatedSolid::DistanceToIn(p,v) for specific cases
        where points are located near surface.
      o Fix in G4GenericTrap::InsidePolygone() to check if p lies between
        the two extremes of the segment. Addressing problem report #1541.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Updated date and version for 9.6.p03.

  o Electromagnetic Processes:
    -------------------------
    + Low Energy:
      o Fixed case of exception from G4PenelopeOscillatorManager for
        specific materials.

        cross-section computation. Addresses problem report #1471.
    + Standard:
      o G4UrbanMscModel95, G4UrbanMscModel96: fixed bug in randomisation
        of 1st step in a volume (useDistanceToBoundary option).
      o G4NuclearStopping: do not reset dynamic charge of an ion, because
        G4ionIonisation process is responsible for that (fix for partially
        charged ion beam)
    + Utils:
      o G4VMultipleScattering: increased lowest limit from 1 eV to 10 eV to
        avoid semi-infinite loop for low-energy particle tracking;
        fixed re-computation of post-step safety in AlongStepDoIt method.
      o G4VEnergyLossProcess, G4VEmProcess: set interaction length to 
        DBL_MAX if process is de-activated (fixed problem of DNA simulation); 
        fixed CrossSectionPerVolume access method.
      o Fixed typo in G4EmBiasingManager.

  o Generic Processes:
    -----------------
    + Decay:
      o Fixed problem of wrong global time for secondaries in case that the
        primary track stops during along step. Addressing problem report #1555.

  o Hadronic Processes:
    ------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o Code optimization for G4ElectroNuclearCrossSection and
        G4PhotoNuclearCrossSection.
    + models/cascade:
      o G4NucleiModel: fixed rare cases of non-reproducibility in
        method generateParticleFate(). Some data was not properly
        initialized in the case that the interaction-partners list has
        one single element.
      o Fixed implementation of G4CascadeParameters singleton to follow
        canonical format. Addressing problem report #1557.
      o G4ParticleLargerEkin, G4ParticleLargerBeta: correct ">=" to ">"
        conditions to avoid error in case that both inputs are identical.
    + models/de_excitation:
      o G4NeutronRadCapture: fixed run time memory leak, fixed time of 
        reaction products.
      o G4ExcitationHandler: if FermiBreakUp returns unchanged fragment
        delete it to avoid minor memory leak; addressing HyperNews post
        #1371. Fixed typo in GetPhotoEvaporation() method name.
        Fixed typo in the SetMaxAForFermiBreakUp() method.
      o G4FermiFragmentsPool: fixed typo for use of G4endl for end line.
      o G4LevelReader, G4NuclearLevelManager: fixed trivial compilation issues
        detected on Visual C++ 18.
    + models/em_dissociation:
      o Fixed memory leak of products from G4ExcitationHandler.
    + models/parton_string/hadronization:
      o Fixed two mistakes in the index manipulation of the BaryonWeight
        4-dimensional vector in G4LundStringFragmentation.
    + models/parton_string/management:
      o Fix to remove 'inline' qualifier from methods in G4VParticipants.cc
        and G4PomeronCrossSection.cc, responsible for cases of run-time
        errors for undefined symbols in library...
    + stopping:
      o G4MuMinusCapturePrecompound: fixed case of infinite loop by
        reimplementing old algorithm of mu- capture which does not include
        direct muon reaction but only considering de-excitation of residual
        fragment. Addressing problem report #1536.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4IonisParamMat: fixed density effect parameterisation.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fixed properties for heavy anti-baryons G4AntiLambdab, G4AntiSigmabZero
      and G4AntiLambdacPlus. Addressing problem report #1571.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + ascii:
      o Corrected typo in G4tgrPlaceParameterisation::operator<<().
        Addressing problem report #1504.
      o Corrected typo in G4tgrUtils::WordIsUnit().
      o Replaced deprecated calls to solids accessor methods.
    + gdml:
      o Fix in G4GDMLReadParamvol::ParametersRead() for reading parameterised
        Sphere, Orb, Torus and Para.
      o Replaced deprecated calls to G4Sphere accessor methods.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + G4EmStandardPhysics_option3, G4EmStandardPhysics_option4,
      G4EmLivermorePhysics, G4EmPenelopePhysics: use RangeFactor=0.01
      for increased simulation accuracy; use G4UrbanMscModel96.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + OpenGL:
      o Fixed bug in the G4OpenGLQtViewer for viewer iterator increment
        checking. Corrected use of 'true' in G4OpenGLQtExportDialog.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + Updated reference outputs.
