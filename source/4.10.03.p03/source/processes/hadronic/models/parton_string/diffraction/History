- G4FTFModel - merged modification from cms_hadr-string-diff-V10-01-16
  on top of hadr-string-diff-V10-01-15 

30-May-2016 A. Ribon    (cms_hadr-string-diff-V10-01-16)
- G4FTFParameters, G4FTFModel : brought back the computation of the
  residual nucleus excitation energy as it was in G4 10.1.
  This should reduce the energy response of hadronic showers in all 
  materials.
  This is a special, internal tag for CMS which should further reduce 
  (with respect to the previous tag) the jet energy scale problem of G4 10.2.

18-May-2016 A. Ribon    (cms_hadr-string-diff-V10-01-15)
- G4FTFParameters : removed the A-dependence in Reggeon Cascade introduced
  in the release G4 10.2 to describe ITEP thin-target data on Carbon.
  This should reduce the energy response of hadronic showers in Iron and
  Copper calorimeters.
  This is a special, internal tag for CMS which should reduce the
  jet energy scale problem of G4 10.2.

5-May-2016 V. Uzhinsky    (hadr-string-diff-V10-01-15)

- G4FTFParameters, G4FTFModel, G4FTFAnnihilation, G4DiffractiveExcitation
  and G4ElasticHNScattering: replaced std::exp, std::log and std::pow
  with the faster G4Exp, G4Log and G4Pow, respectively.
  This changes the random number sequence.

13-Jul-2015 A. Dotti    (hadr-string-diff-V10-01-11)

19-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (hadr-string-diff-V10-00-11)
- Bug connected with abnormal stable meson masses is fixed. Change of masses of particles in
  quark-exchange processes is improved.

  A problem of energy/momentum non-conservation in Xi- nucleus interactions is partly solved.
  Energy/momentum is now conserved, but an acurate treatment of minimal difractive masses of
  strange particles is needed. 

19-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (hadr-string-diff-V10-00-10)
- 2 bugs are fixed. The first one was connected with multiple quark exchanges in hA interactions
  accompanated by string excitations. A status of such hadrons was not set in a right manner.
  The second bug was in the determination of anti-alpha particle 4-momentum at stopping (at low
  energy). All changes were marked "Uzhi 18 Nov. 2014".


15-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (hadr-string-diff-V10-00-09)
- Bug is fixed. It was connected with missing of treating of involved nucleons
  of a projectile nucleus in FTFmodel (Case5 instead of Case 4).

-  Bug is fixed in G4DiffractiveSplitableHadron.cc where baryons are subdivided
   into quark and diquark. Suppresion of uu-diquark in proton is also introduced.
   Diquarks with identical quarks are now suppressed on 50 % (probability 1/6) except
   baryon like Delta++ (uuu), Delta- (ddd) and so on.

-  Parameters of FTF model are re-tuned in accordance with the hypothesis.
   New paremeters are implemented in G4FTFParameters.cc

-  Bug is fixed in G4DiffractiveExcitation.cc which leads to asymmetric rapidity
   distributions in pp-interactions. Analogous bug can be with kinky strings.
   It is not fount up to now. Thus, creation of the kinky strings is closed.

   partially tuned process cross sections for pp-, Kp- and Pi p interactions.
   Description of Pi p interactions is still unsattisfactory. The variant
   has to work with LundStringFragmentation where Z^2 fragmentation function
   is implemented for qq-fragmentations.

23-May-2014 A. Ribon       (hadr-string-diff-V10-00-01)
-  Fix bug #1550 : extend the vectors CandAQ, CandQ of G4FTFAnnihilation

   handle antiproton - proton and antineutron - neutron annihilations.
   Prepare also for Anti_Delta-- and Delta++ annihilation.

21-May-2014 A. Ribon       (hadr-string-diff-V10-00-00)

   I have foggoten to open quasi-elastic scattering!
   Now it is openned.
----------------------------------------------------------
17 Sept., 2009, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-12)
   FTF parameters have been tunned on hN-interactions.
   Binary reactions were introduced and checked.
   Creation of s-channel Delta's was erased.

  Kaon A interactions are improved in FTFModel.
----------------------------------------------------------
6 August 2009, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-10)
  A warning message at FTFmodel compilation connected with Xminus
  initialisation was erased.
----------------------------------------------------------
5 August 2009, V.Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-09)
  Some additional warning found by Gabriela were erased.
------------------------------------------------------------
5 August 2009, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-08)
  Warning meassages were erased at a compilation of FTF model
-----------------------------------------------------------
3 August 2009, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-07)
   FTF model with the reggeon cascading was complited by
   formation time for a following coupling with the binary model.

31 July 2009, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-05)
   The reggeon theory inspired model of duclear desctruction is
   implemented for a simulation of low particle cascading.
   The code can operate with Precompound model only.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17 July V. Uzhinsky        (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-04)
   A Status of nuclear nucleon involved in an interaction is introdused.
   Status: 0 - spectator, 1 - primary involved nucleon, 2 - a nucleon
   involved in the reggeon cascading, 3 - absorbed nucleon.

   A connection between a participant nucleon and a nuclear nucleon was
   introsuced in G4InteractionContent.

   All of these allow to improve FTF model for pion obsorption on nuclei.
   These required a lot of changes.
---------------------------------------------------------

10 July V. Uzhinsky        (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-03)
Bug was fixed in G4FTFModel.cc thank to A. Ribon
---------------------------------------------------------
9 July 2009 V. Uzhinsky    (hadr-string-diff-V09-02-02)
- Charge-exchange was implemented for pn->np 
  elastic and inelastic interactions.
- Pion absorption by a nucleon was implemented.

 Version of FTF suted for low energies (2-10 GeV/c)

9 December 08, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-01-04)
- Improvement of delete operators in FTF

5 December 08, V. Uzhinsky (hadr-string-diff-V09-01-03)
- Some objects did not erase in FTFModel desructor. These lead to memory 
  leak.


2 June 08, G.Folger 		(hadr-string-diff-V09-01-02)
-  on branch geant4-09-01-patches_branch, fix compilation warning for unused 
     variables in G4FTFModel.cc

31 March 2008 V. Uzhinsky           Tag : hadr-string-diff-V09-01-00
- G4FTFParameters.cc and G4FTFParameters.hh were copied from G4FTFCrossSection
  corresponding files.
- New files - G4ElasticHNScattering have been added. They implement elastic 
  scattering of hadron in intra-nuclear collisions in FTF model.
- The corresponding changes have been done in G4FTFModel.cc and 
  G4FTFParticipants.cc

  
24 Apr 2007 Gunter Folger  (hadr-string-diff-V08-02-00)
-  merge in change done by ftf development.
- Created History file.
